  "text": "Does the Blast-RADIUS vulnerability affect Portnox Cloud users?\nWhat is the Blast-RADIUS vulnerability?\nThe Blast-RADIUS (BlastRADIUS) vulnerability (CVE-2024-3596) is a vulnerability in the RADIUS protocol (RFC 2865).\nThis vulnerability is considered very low risk for Portnox Cloud for the following reasons:\nThe research is purely theoretical and no attacks in the wild have been observed.\nThe attack would require an attacker to assume a man-in-the-middle position between the NAS device and the RADIUS server, so either within the customer’s infrastructure or within the ISP infrastructure.\nThe attack requires high computational power to calculate an MD5 collision before the RADIUS timeout.\nThe attack affects only direct UDP communications with the RADIUS server. The 802.1X protocol is not affected.\nWhich parts of Portnox Cloud could be affected?\nNot affected:\nNetwork authentication using credentials or certificates is not affected because it uses the 802.1X protocol.\nLocal RADIUS servers are not affected. All communications between the local RADIUS server’s virtual machine or container and the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers are conducted through secure TLS tunnels.\nTACACS+ services are not affected. All communications between the TACACS+ local virtual machine or container and the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers are conducted through secure TLS tunnels.\nZero Trust Network Access is not affected. All communication with the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers is conducted internally within the Portnox secure infrastructure.\nAny devices and software that use the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute in RADIUS communications are not affected.\nCould be affected:\nMAC-based authentication (MAB), if your NAS device does not use the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute. While most NAS devices support this attribute, you may need to upgrade those NAS devices to the latest firmware version. We recommend checking with your NAS manufacturer and immediately install any new firmware, if available.\nVPN authentication, if your VPN server does not use the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute. We recommend that you check with your VPN server manufacturer and immediately install any new firmware or security patches.\nWhat can I do to protect myself better?\nWhile the risk of Blast-RADIUS is very low, you may do the following to protect yourself:\nIf using Portnox Cloud for 802.1X authentication only (credential-based or certificate-based network access): No action needed. You are not affected.\nIf using Portnox Cloud for TACACS+ only: No action needed. You are not affected.\nIf using Portnox Cloud for Zero Trust Network Access only: No action needed. You are not affected.\nIf using Portnox Cloud for MAC-based authentication: \nOption 1: Configure your NAS devices and your Portnox Cloud RADIUS for RadSec communications. For more information, see the topic: Configure advanced RADIUS server options.\nOption 2: If the latest firmware of your NAS device supports the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute, update the firmware of your NAS device to the latest version.\nOption 3: Install a local RADIUS server within your local network as close as possible to the NAS devices, and configure your NAS devices to use this local RADIUS server as your primary RADIUS server. Then, all RADIUS communications between your infrastructure and the Portnox infrastructure will be conducted through a secure TLS tunnel. Note that with this solution, an attack is still possible, but only from the inside of your infrastructure (if the attacker is able to modify the traffic between your NAS devices and your local RADIUS server).\nIf using Portnox Cloud for VPN authentication: \nOption 1: Configure your VPN server and your Portnox Cloud RADIUS for RadSec communications. For more information, see the topic: Configure advanced RADIUS server options.\nOption 2: If the latest firmware or software version of your VPN server supports the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute, update the firmware or software of your VPN server to the latest version.\nOption 3: Install a local RADIUS server within your local network as close as possible to the VPN server, and configure your VPN server to use this local RADIUS server as your primary RADIUS server. Then, all RADIUS communications between your infrastructure and the Portnox infrastructure will be conducted through a secure TLS tunnel. Note that with this solution, an attack is still possible, but only from the inside of your infrastructure (if the attacker is able to modify the traffic between your VPN server and your local RADIUS server).\nNote: The blast-RADIUS issue lies within the RADIUS protocol itself, and only the proper configuration of NAS devices can guarantee security against this vulnerability. While our server could achieve complete immunity by requiring the Message-Authenticator attribute, this would unfortunately make it incompatible with many NAS devices that have not yet implemented this support. Therefore, for devices that already support this attribute, we recommend a firmware upgrade, and for those that are not yet compatible with the Message-Authenticator attribute, we recommend that you consider using RadSec."

  "text": "When does Portnox Cloud consume a license?\nIn this topic, you will find answers to some common questions about Portnox Cloud licensing.\nDoes a device that is denied access consume a license?\nYes: If Portnox Cloud places the new device in a restricted VLAN or applies an Access Control List, this device consumes a license.\nNo: If a device is denied access to the network completely, it does not consume a license.\nDoes a device with multiple network interfaces consume more than one license?\nYes: If the device is not managed by AgentP or Intune, Portnox Cloud has no way to recognize that different network interfaces belong to a single physical device, so each interface consumes one license. This could be an Ethernet interface, Wi-Fi interface, docking station Ethernet interface, etc.\nNo: If the device is managed by AgentP or Intune (requires the device ID SAN value), Portnox Cloud recognizes that the network interfaces belong to the same device and no extra licenses are consumed. \nWhere to find accurate information about license consumption?\nThe tile on the Dashboard that says Total devices in organization.\nIn the subscription plan: \nIn the devices.csv spreadsheet: ."

  "url": "https://docs.portnox.com/topics/faq_map.html",
  "text": "How does the dashboard map widget determine a device’s location?\nThe interactive map widget on the Portnox Cloud Dashboard shows device locations, but they may not be exact.\nIf Portnox Cloud can obtain exact geolocation information, for example, from AgentP installed on a mobile device (if, during installation, the user allowed to share their geolocation information with AgentP, and if geolocation services on the mobile device are active), then the map location is exact and based on this geolocation information. However, the location is updated once an hour, not in real time.\nIn most cases, there is no geolocation data for an endpoint device (such as a desktop computer with no GPS module) or there is no way to obtain geolocation information from the device (such information is not part of network communication, and is not tracked by authentication repositories). In such cases, Portnox Cloud can only get geolocation information from the public IP address of the device, which is usually managed by the Internet service provider (ISP), and points to the ISP’s network center, not to a specific endpoint location."

This will allow everyone to utilize CoA, not just those using Active Directory. You will also no longer need to choose between CoA or RADIUS redundancy, as this functionality is incorporated directly into the same RADIUS container. Existing customers leveraging LDAP Broker for Change of Authorization will remain unaffected, and CoA will continue to function as it always has. We do, however, recommend all customers begin planning to leverage the local RADIUS docker container for CoA in the future.\nAAA Troubleshooting Logs now include a live mode, similar to live tail (tail -f) in Linux. This live mode can be used in conjunction with filters to greatly simplify the troubleshooting process, allowing you to see only those events you’re interested in as they happen, without needing to constantly refresh the page. Live mode can also be paused any time, so you are never overwhelmed with a flurry of new incoming events.\nAgentP for Apple silicon – A new version of AgentP for macOS with native support for Apple silicon (Mx Series processors) will begin slowly rolling out shortly following the 2024.03 release. This new version of AgentP will no longer require Rosetta be enabled on your M-Series macOS device. MacOS devices with any previous version of AgentP running on M-Series hardware will automatically be upgraded to an Apple silicon native version without any user intervention required. Those running macOS on Intel processors will remain unaffected by this change.\nBug fixes and changes\nResolved an issue where device status was incorrect when the device was managed by both Intune and Entra ID.\nRemoved the PIN Code option from the risk score for macOS devices.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2024.02\nUpdate published on: Feb 12, 2024\nNew features and improvements in this release\nNew, refreshed toast messages.\nAbility to filter alerts by Site.\nAbility to filter devices by AgentP Last reported date.\nUsability improvements for TACACS+ alerts\nAdded anti-flood merging to prevent overloading with TACACS+ alerts.\nAdded an alert for failed authentications due to MFA and User needs password reset.\nAdded alert for ambiguous usernames\nBug fixes\nResolved an issue where lengthy RADIUS authentications could result in duplicate devices created.\nResolved an issue where messages sent by the Portnox Cloud SIEM integration via HTTPS using the CEF format was not working.\nResolved an issue where only the first 100 accounts were selected by the Select all checkbox on the Devices grid.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.12\nUpdate published on: Dec 18, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nIt is now possible to define custom RADIUS attributes dynamically for different user groups and devices.\nA Docker container for local RADIUS is now available as an alternative to our virtual appliance for deployment in IaaS clouds such as Azure, AWS, and GCP.\nSecurity enhancements\nRead-only Admins may now view TACACS+ policies.\nAudited events in the Activity Log can now be sent to your configured SIEM solution.\nUsability and supportability improvements\nWhen a custom NAS-Display name is defined it is now used in place of the default NAS name in SIEM events.\nOur latest documentation is now accessible and searchable from within the product Help page.\nA link to the AgentP download page has been added to Help page navigation.\nRemoved MDM Settings from Groups as this feature no longer works with newer versions of iOS.\nAddressed issue where sometimes only a single alert would be shown on the Alerts view until the page was refreshed.\nThe Subscription Plan page has been updated to remove references to previously offered subscription plans.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.11\nUpdate published on: Nov 13, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nAAA Logs Improvements – Administrators can load AAA logs into browser memory, so they can sort and search AAA logs directly from Clear portal.\nTACACS+ MFA – TACACS+ administrators can leverage AgentP as a second factor authentication for authentication and authorization.\nNew TACACS+ Docker Container – Administrators can use a token for authentication and pass it to the container as a secret.\nAgentP – AgentP is now available for Android version 13 and 14.\nRead-only Admins with Entra ID accounts can now receive reports.\nAdded an ability for Cloud and Contractor accounts to change their passwords.\nAdded the MAC address into the RADIUS failed to Authenticate device SIEM message.\nImproved performance and scalability for exporting Accounts/Devices from the Devices grid.\nImproved performance of AAA logs download.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.10\nUpdate published on: Oct 03, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nTACACS+ Policies – Administrators can create TACACS+ policies with dynamic condition to a group.

When both user and device certificates are used and no one is logged into the machine, only the machine itself is authenticated to the network using the device certificate. You may configure that device to be assigned to a different VLAN or ACL for least privilege, ensuring the device is still able to be managed remotely and receive updates, but nothing more. Once a user logs into the machine, the device will re-authenticate to the network using that user’s certificate, assigning the correct ACL or VLAN that will allow that user to access only the resources on the network that are needed.\nIt is now possible to add individual users from an Authentication Repository to Portnox Cloud groups. No longer do you need to coordinate with whomever manages the identity provider in your environment to have custom groups created for specific use cases. Instead, the Portnox Cloud admin can add one or several different individual users to any Portnox Cloud group themselves, just as easily as adding groups. You can even combine groups and individual users from any authentication repository into any Portnox Group.\nThose working with large lists of MAC Addresses for MAB accounts will notice some significant usability improvements, such as the ability to search for MAC address, and filter options such as vendor and expiration.\nmacOS and Windows minimum supported versions can now be defined as part of a Risk Policy, similar to iOS and Android.\nThe TACACS+ service is now available as an optional Docker container for both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures.

E.g. searching for 192.168.0.2 will function as it always has, returning 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.22. However, searching for '192.168.0.2' in quoted notation will return only 192.168.0.2.\n5xx & 4xx error pages now include direct links to Portnox status and support pages.\nAuthentication failures for unsupported MSCHAPv2 authentication type no longer creates device objects or consume device entitlements.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.5\nUpdate published on: May 29, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nIoT device trust (new feature)\nDetect and automate remediation actions for MAC address bypass (MAB) spoofing attacks Entra ID Integration (improvement).\nCloud administrators can now renew the token used for their Entra ID application integration.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.04\nUpdate published on: Apr 24, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nSecure Syslog over TLS has been added as a new protocol for forwarding alerts to SIEM solutions.\nNew Devices/Accounts page is now default (you are still able to switch for old page).\nAll links (e.g. from Alerts) are now routed to the new Devices/Accounts page.\nA feature for saving the filter has been added to the new Devices/Accounts page.\nFixed an issue with deleting multiple devices.\nFixed sorting.\nAdded a preview for device-based accounts, so users can verify the results of a query.\nImproved concurrent editing of MAC-based accounts.\nAPI tokens can now be used with external authentication repositories.\nAuthentication region has been added to SIEM alerts.\nImprovements on repository synchronization to reduce alerting noise.\nLicensing improvement to not count device twice, when two certificates are used on the same machine.\nFixed the subscription expiration alert to show the correct amount of remaining days.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.3\nUpdate published on: Mar 27, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nIoT device type accounts – Utilize IoT fingerprint information to automate and orchestrate those devices access to the network. For example, assign all Roku and Apple TV streaming devices to VLAN 44.

  "text": "Glossary\n802.1X\n802.1X is a networking protocol that enables secure AAA control. When a device (called a supplicant) first contacts a NAS (called an authenticator), it is only allowed to authenticate. The NAS sends the device’s authentication information to a RADIUS server (called an authentication server) that verifies the credentials provided by the device. If the credentials are valid, the authentication server responds to the authenticator, which then lets the supplicant connect to the network. The authentication server can also suggests that the authenticator uses a specific VLAN to connect the supplicant.\n802.1X operates at the data link layer and supports multiple EAP authentication methods. It prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the network by enforcing authentication before network access is granted. The protocol is commonly used in wired and wireless LANs for port-based network access control.\nNote: In spoken language, 802.1X is often pronounced as “dot-one-ex”.\nAAA: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\nAccounting\nAccounting lets you collect information locally on a network device and send it to the server for billing, auditing, and reporting. It lets you track and keep a log of every management session used for access.\nAccounting records details such as session start and stop times, duration, data usage, and actions performed. This data helps in monitoring network usage, detecting anomalies, and generating usage reports for compliance and operational analysis.\nAgentless\nAgentless is a common industry term that means checking endpoint compliance without installing a special software agent. This method uses existing tools or built-in features on the device to gather information.\nIn Portnox Cloud, the term agentless means no Portnox AgentP is installed on the device. Instead, compliance data is collected through built-in agents like the Windows Intune agent or agents from other UEM or MDM software. These existing agents provide the necessary information without needing an extra agent.\nAuthentication\nAuthentication is the process of verifying the identity of the person or device accessing your network. It involves validating credentials such as usernames and passwords, digital certificates, or cryptographic tokens. Authentication ensures that only authorized users or devices can gain access, providing the first layer of security before authorization and access control are applied.\nAuthorization\nAuthorization is the process of checking what the user is authorized to do. For example, RADIUS and TACACS+ authorize users for specific rights by associating attribute/value pairs, which define the rights and the appropriate users.\nCIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)\nClassless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method of allocating and managing IP addresses more efficiently. Instead of using traditional class-based addressing, CIDR allows for flexible allocation of address space by using a slash notation (e.g., /24) to indicate the number of network bits in an IP address, allowing for better utilization of available addresses and easier routing.\nCIDR notation combines the IP address with a prefix length to define network and host portions. It supports aggregation of multiple IP ranges into a single routing entry, reducing the size of routing tables and improving routing efficiency across the internet and private networks.\nDHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)\nDHCP is a protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration details (like subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers) to devices when they join a network. This removes the need for manual IP configuration, making network management more efficient and less error-prone. DHCP is one of the core services in most enterprise and home networks and is typically handled by routers, dedicated DHCP servers, or wireless controllers.\nWhile DHCP plays a critical role in configuring devices at the network layer (Layer 3), it is not involved in access control decisions. It operates independently of authentication protocols such as 802.1X and RADIUS, which are handled at Layer 2 before IP address assignment. In Portnox Cloud, DHCP is used only after a device has successfully connected – its traffic is analyzed to help fingerprint the device based on patterns typical of specific device types or manufacturers. This post-authentication analysis supports functions like device identification and MAC spoofing detection.\nEAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)\nThe Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework. It offers different EAP methods, which are specific authentication protocols, such as EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, EAP-MD5, and EAP-TTLS. EAP is used in 802.1X communications. EAP packets are encapsulated in EAPoL (EAP over LAN) messages. EAPoL makes it possible to carry EAP packets between the client device (supplicant), the access point (authenticator), and the authentication server (RADIUS server).\nEAP itself does not define authentication mechanisms but provides a standard way to transport authentication information. It supports mutual authentication, dynamic key generation, and flexible use in wired and wireless networks. EAP messages are exchanged during the network access control process before granting network access.\nEndpoint compliance\nEndpoint compliance is a common industry term that refers to checking if a device meets specific security rules before it is allowed to access a network (security posture assessment). These rules may include having updated software, antivirus protection, and proper configuration. Devices that do not meet these requirements are considered non-compliant.\nCompliance checks are typically performed using software agents installed on the device. These agents collect information about the device’s security status, such as operating system updates, installed applications, and security settings. Some devices may use built-in management agents provided by their operating systems to report compliance data. The collected information is compared to policy requirements to determine if the device is compliant.\nFast reconnect\nFast reconnect, also known as EAP session resumption, is a function that lets devices reconnect quickly to the NAS. When fast reconnect is supported by a device and enabled on the RADIUS server, the device sends a session identifier to the RADIUS server via EAP, after it authenticates with the NAS for the first time. If the device then loses connection to the NAS, it sends the recent session identifier. If the RADIUS server recognizes this session identifier, and the session is still valid (depending on session lifetime), it immediately authenticates the device. This reduces the time and resources required for authentication, for example, it eliminates the need to connect to authentication repositories after every reconnection.\nFast reconnect relies on caching session keys and identifiers both on the client and the RADIUS server. It supports quicker re-establishment of encrypted sessions without repeating the full EAP authentication exchange, improving connection speed and reducing authentication server load. Session validity is controlled by configurable timeouts.\nIAM (identity and access management)\nIdentity and access management is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies used to manage digital identities and control user access to resources within an organization. IAM ensures that the right individuals have the appropriate access to technology resources at the right times and for the right reasons.\nIAM systems handle user authentication (verifying identity), authorization (defining access rights), and account management tasks such as creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts. IAM supports security requirements by enforcing access policies, monitoring user activity, and enabling compliance with regulations. It often integrates with identity providers (IdPs) and supports protocols like SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for single sign-on (SSO).\nIdP (identity provider)\nAn identity provider (IdP) is a system that performs user authentication and provides identity information to other systems or applications. It is a central part of single sign-on (SSO) setups, where users log in once through the IdP and then gain access to multiple services without logging in again.\nIn SAML-based SSO, the IdP generates and sends a SAML assertion to confirm the user’s identity. In OpenID Connect (OIDC), the IdP handles the login and issues an ID token that includes the user’s identity details. The applications that rely on the IdP to verify users are called service providers (in SAML) or clients (in OIDC). The IdP ensures consistent and secure user authentication across systems. Common identity providers include Microsoft Entra ID, Google Identity Platform, Okta, Ping Identity, and Auth0.\nIoT (Internet of Things)\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects physical objects, like devices with sensors and communication abilities, to the Internet. These objects can collect and share data without humans having to control them directly. There is no formal definition of whether the physical device is an IoT device or not. For the purposes of Portnox Cloud, we use the term “IoT device” to refer to any devices that are not directly used by humans, do not have user accounts, but still form part of the network. This includes devices like printers, scanners, surveillance cameras, air conditioners, and any other networked devices in the company offices that might be connected to the company network.\nIoT fingerprinting\nFingerprinting is the process of identifying a device based on unique characteristics it exposes, rather than relying on user-provided credentials or certificates. These characteristics can include network behavior, protocol patterns, hardware identifiers, and other metadata. Fingerprinting is commonly used in security and networking.\nPortnox uses fingerprinting to identify and classify IoT devices. This is done by analyzing the MAC address to determine the manufacturer and then examining DHCP traffic patterns. Many devices send DHCP requests in a predictable and characteristic way, based on their operating system or firmware. By matching these patterns to known profiles, Portnox can determine the actual type and identity of a device with high accuracy.\nFingerprinting is also used to detect MAC spoofing attempts. If a device connects using a MAC address that has already been seen on the network, Portnox checks its fingerprint against the one previously associated with that MAC. If the DHCP behavior does not match, the device is assumed to be an impostor, and access is denied. This helps protect against attackers who manually assign a known MAC address to their own device to bypass access controls.\nIPSK (Identity Pre-Shared Key)\nIPSK (Identity Pre-Shared Key) is a Wi-Fi authentication method supported by major manufacturers’ access points, which allows multiple pre-shared keys (PSKs) on the same SSID. Each key can be linked to a specific device or user and checked against a RADIUS server. For devices using MAB, IPSK improves security by requiring both the MAC address and a PSK to match. This prevents MAC spoofing since just copying the MAC address isn’t enough to connect.\nIPSK integrates with RADIUS servers to validate credentials and enforce policies per user or device. It allows centralized management of multiple keys and provides better control over Wi-Fi network access compared to traditional single PSK methods.\nNetwork access layers\nNetwork access layers refer to the different ways devices can connect to a network: wireless, wired, and VPN. These layers define how devices establish communication and access network resources using technologies like Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or virtual private networks (VPNs).\nEach access layer has specific protocols and security mechanisms. Wired access typically uses Ethernet with IEEE 802.3 standards. Wireless access uses IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards and includes encryption methods like WPA3. VPN access creates secure tunnels over public networks using protocols such as IPSec or SSL/TLS to protect data in transit.\nLDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)\nThe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a protocol used for managing and accessing directory information within a computer network. LDAP organizes information about users, such as names, contact details, and other relevant data. The term is also often used to describe servers that store directory information and make it accessible using this protocol.\nLDAP operates over TCP/IP, typically on ports 389 (unencrypted) and 636 (encrypted with SSL/TLS). It uses a hierarchical structure similar to X.500 but simplifies communication by using the simpler LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF). LDAP supports searching, modifying, adding, and deleting directory entries and is widely used for authentication and authorization services.\nMAB (MAC Authentication Bypass)\nMAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) is a workaround method to connect devices to 802.1X networks. In an 802.1X network, devices are typically required to authenticate using a username and password, digital certificates, or other authentication methods before gaining access to the network. However, there may be scenarios where certain devices, such as printers, IP phones, or other IoT devices, do not have the capability to perform the standard 802.1X authentication. To accommodate such devices, network administrators can pre-configure a list of approved MAC addresses for specific devices, allowing them to bypass the usual authentication process and gain network access directly. The NAS devices will then check the MAC address of the connecting device against the pre-approved list, granting access to the devices that match the allowed MAC addresses. Note that the NAS devices must support MAB authentication for this to be possible.\nMAB operates by sending the device’s MAC address as a username to the RADIUS server for authentication. It provides limited security compared to 802.1X because MAC addresses can be spoofed. MAB is often used as a fallback method when 802.1X authentication fails or is unsupported by the device.\nMAC address (Media Access Control)\nA MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication within a local network. It is a 48-bit address expressed in hexadecimal format and is typically associated with Ethernet or Wi-Fi devices. The MAC address is used by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to map IP addresses to physical MAC addresses in order to make it possible for devices to communicate on the network.\nMAC addresses consist of two parts: the first 24 bits identify the device manufacturer (OUI), and the last 24 bits are assigned by the manufacturer as a unique device identifier. MAC addresses operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and are essential for local network traffic delivery.\nMAC spoofing\nMAC spoofing is the act of manually changing the MAC address of a network interface on a device in order to impersonate another device on the network. Since many access control systems rely on MAC addresses for identification, spoofing allows an attacker to potentially bypass security restrictions by mimicking an authorized device. Most operating systems and network cards support changing the MAC address, making this type of attack relatively easy to carry out.\nTo detect and block MAC spoofing, Portnox Cloud compares additional device-specific indicators beyond the MAC address itself. When a device connects using a known MAC, the system examines its network behavior – specifically, DHCP traffic patterns – and matches it against the expected fingerprint for that MAC. If the fingerprint does not match the previously observed profile, Portnox assumes the device has been spoofed and blocks its access, raising an alert.\nNAS (network access server)\nIn the context of RADIUS, the network access server is a device or software component that provides a point of entry for users to access a network. It acts as a gateway between the user’s device and the network infrastructure. The NAS is responsible for receiving and processing user authentication requests, forwarding them to the RADIUS server, and relaying the server’s response back to the user. Typically, NAS devices include network equipment such as routers, switches, wireless access points, VPN servers, or even dedicated NAS devices. They are responsible for controlling user access to network resources, enforcing security policies, and managing network connections.\nNote: The NAS acronym also stands for network-attached storage, but we never use it in this context in Portnox Cloud and its documentation.\nOIDC (OpenID Connect)\nOpenID Connect is an identity protocol commonly used for single sign-on (SSO). Like SAML, it allows users to authenticate once through a trusted external system and then access multiple applications without repeated logins. OIDC is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which is a widely used standard for granting access to resources without sharing user passwords.\nOAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows a user to give an application access to specific data or services hosted by another system, without exposing their login credentials. OIDC extends this by adding authentication, confirming who the user is. In OIDC, the application (called the client) redirects the user to an identity provider (IdP), which handles the login. If successful, the IdP returns an ID token containing verified identity information. The client uses this token to establish a secure session with the user.\nOUI (organizationally unique identifier)\nAn OUI is the first part of the MAC address, specifying the manufacturer of the device. OUIs are controlled by the IEEE, who assign unique codes to manufacturers. They are also called MAC prefixes or Ethernet prefixes.\nAn OUI consists of 24 bits (three bytes) written as the first six hexadecimal digits of a MAC address. It is used by network tools and monitoring systems to identify device vendors and can be looked up in public IEEE registration databases.\nPolicy enforcement\nPolicy enforcement is the process of defining and applying rules that control network access based on factors such as user roles, device types, location, and time. These rules determine what resources a user or device can access.\nFor example, a policy might restrict a contractor’s laptop to only connect to the guest Wi-Fi network and block access to internal company resources. Enforcement ensures that network access follows the organization’s security requirements.\nRADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)\nRADIUS is a network protocol that lets you manage access to your networks. Network devices such as switches and access points can use RADIUS to authenticate and authorize devices trying to connect to the network such as computers, mobiles, and IoT.\nRADIUS works over UDP and combines authentication, authorization, and accounting in a single process. It uses a client server model where the network device acts as a client and forwards user credentials to a central RADIUS server.\nRadSec (RADIUS secure)\nRadSec is a security extension for the RADIUS protocol, adding a layer of encryption. This is achieved by encapsulating RADIUS messages within a TLS (Transport Layer Security) tunnel. RadSec is a standard defined in RFC 6614, but is currently supported by a limited number of NAS devices.\nRadSec uses TCP as transport instead of UDP and provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity for RADIUS traffic. It is commonly used across untrusted networks such as the public internet to secure communication between RADIUS clients and servers.\nSAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)\nSAML is a standard protocol used for single sign-on (SSO). It allows users to log in once through a central system and then access multiple services without needing to log in again. This is commonly used in organizations to manage access to cloud applications and internal systems.\nIn a SAML setup, the central login system is called the identity provider (IdP). The service the user is trying to access, such as an application or website, is called the service provider (SP). When a user tries to access the service, they are redirected to the IdP to log in. After successful login, the IdP sends a secure message called an assertion back to the service provider. This assertion contains information that proves the user’s identity. The service provider uses this information to decide whether to allow access.\nSCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol)\nThe Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is a commonly used communication protocol that allows devices to seek and obtain digital certificates from a certificate authority (CA). It secures and simplifies the process of enrolling for and managing certificates. SCEP is used by integrated endpoint management solutions to distribute Portnox Cloud certificates as part of automatic device onboarding.\nSCEP is an HTTP-based protocol defined in an IETF draft. It supports certificate signing requests, certificate retrieval, and certificate renewal. It uses shared secrets for initial authentication and is supported by many network devices, mobile device management systems, and public key infrastructure products.\nSSO (single sign-on)\nSingle sign-on is a login method that lets users access multiple systems or applications with one set of credentials. Instead of logging in separately to each service, users authenticate once and gain access to all connected services without needing to enter their username and password again.\nSSO works by using a central system, often called an identity provider (IdP), to handle authentication. When a user tries to access a service, the service redirects the user to the IdP. If the user is already logged in, the IdP confirms the user’s identity and sends that information back to the service. This allows the user to access multiple services securely and efficiently using a single login session.\nTACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)\nTACACS+ is a Cisco extension to the TACACS network protocol that centrally manages authentication, authorization, and accounting for network devices like switches and routers, ensuring secure access control and administrative control. It is often compared to RADIUS. The main difference between RADIUS and TACACS lies in their functionalities, where RADIUS focuses on authentication and accounting, while TACACS+ provides additional features like granular access control and command authorization for enhanced network security and administrative control.\nTACACS+ uses TCP as transport on port 49 and encrypts the entire payload of each packet. It separates authentication, authorization, and accounting into distinct processes. It is commonly deployed on network access servers and device consoles for centralized administrator login and auditing.\nTenant (software)\nA tenant is an instance of a software application or service that is used by a specific group or organization. Each tenant has its own isolated environment and is logically separated from other tenants, so the organization data is private and secure.\nA tenant can exist in cloud platforms and SaaS products. For example, an Entra ID tenant is a dedicated and isolated instance in Microsoft Entra ID used for identity, access, and resource management and is linked to a company domain and subscriptions. A Portnox Cloud tenant is a separate cloud instance where an organization manages network policies, connected devices, and user authentication independently from other organizations.\nX.500 Directory Specification\nThe X.500 Directory Specification is a standardized protocol used in IT to structure and manage information within a directory service. This specification follows a hierarchical model where data is stored in a tree-like structure. For instance, an entry like \"CN=Kosh Naranek, O=Vorlon Corp, C=US\" would be organized within this structure, containing attributes such as Common Name (CN) representing the person’s name, Organization (O) detailing the company name, and Country (C) indicating the United States. X.500 is the basis for modern directory services like LDAP, ensuring orderly data storage and easy information management in networks.\nX.500 defines the directory information tree, distinguished names, schema for object classes and attributes, replication of directory data between servers, and distributed directory access using the Directory Access Protocol and Directory System Protocol. It is standardized in ITU-T recommendations X.500 to X.599 and operates over OSI protocols.\nZTNA (zero trust network access)\nZero trust network access is a common industry term for a security framework that requires verification of user and device identity before granting access to network resources, including for example web applications and other services. It enforces access based on least-privilege principles and continuous authentication, regardless of network location. ZTNA replaces traditional perimeter-based security with strict access control using user identity, device posture, and contextual information.\nPortnox ZTNA is a product that implements this framework by enforcing access policies through continuous verification of device compliance and user credentials. It integrates with network infrastructure and authentication systems to apply dynamic, context-based access controls. Access is granted only when devices and users meet predefined security requirements."

  "text": "How does the Portnox Cloud TACACS+ service work?\nIn this topic, you will learn how the Portnox™ Cloud TACACS+ service works.\nThe Portnox Cloud TACACS+ service is a local server. To set it up, you have two options:\nVirtual machines: You need to download a virtual machine image and its configuration, deploy it locally, and connect it to your on-premises network.\nContainers: You need to deploy a Docker container locally or in the cloud, and connect it to the on-premises network.\nThen, you need to configure your NAS devices to use this local TACACS+ server for authentication, authorization, and accounting.\nWhen a user connects to one of your NAS devices configured with TACACS+, the NAS device communicates with the local TACACS+ server.\nThe local TACACS+ server first checks user authentication by connecting to Cloud and getting authentication information from the configured authentication repository.\nIf the user is authenticated, the local TACACS+ server accesses the TACACS+ policy defined in Portnox Cloud, assigned to the user’s group.\nThe TACACS+ policy defines user authorization for services, commands, and command attributes on the NAS device. The NAS device is configured for session-based or command-based authorization. If it is configured for session-based authorization, it only requests the session to be authorized. If it is configured for command-based authorization, each command run on the NAS device needs authorization from the TACACS+ server.\nThe NAS device then reports user activity details to the TACACS+ server, and the TACACS+ server sends it to Portnox Cloud for accounting purposes. Portnox Cloud administrators can access alerts and troubleshooting logs to see user actions on the NAS devices.\nImportant: The Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ does not cache the authentication/authorization information if the Internet connection is lost, because most NAS devices that support TACACS+ have internal TACACS+ caching functionality. Please refer to the manual of your device to learn how to activate TACACS+ information caching on that device.\nNote: You can set up Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrators, but this can only be done by using Portnox AgentP as the authenticator tool."

Integration happens by exchanging a set of single sign-on (SSO) identifiers and URLs. To integrate with an identity provider or with an application, you simply need to copy some values from the configuration screen of one product and paste them into the right fields on a configuration screen of the other product.\nZTNA supports a globally recognized mechanisms for single sign-on integration: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC).\nIntegrating with an identity provider\nWhen you integrate ZTNA with an SAML identity provider, you must create a custom app in the identity provider configuration, and then copy at least the following values from the Portnox Cloud configuration screen to a custom app configuration screen:\nThe Portnox Cloud identifier that it generated for the identity provider, so that Cloud can recognize and trust the communication\nThe Portnox Cloud URL to which the identity provider is supposed to send the user after successfully authenticating them\nYou must also copy at least the following values from the identity provider’s custom SAML app configuration screen to the Portnox Cloud configuration screen:\nThe identity provider’s URL to which Portnox Cloud is supposed to redirect users for authentication\nThe identity provider’s identifier used in its single sign-on tokens\nThe identity provider’s security certificate, so that Portnox Cloud can verify that it’s communicating with the identity provider and not an intruder\nThe process for OIDC identity providers is very similar and also involves only copying values across between Portnox Cloud and the identity provider’s administration interface.\nIn the left-hand side menu, you will find examples for popular identity providers. For example, Entra ID and Google Workspace.\nIntegrating with a web application\nWhen you integrate a SAML web application with ZTNA, you must copy at least the following values from the Portnox Cloud configuration screen to the application configuration screen:\nThe Portnox Cloud identifier that the application is supposed to use during communication, so that Cloud can recognize and trust the incoming authentication requests\nThe Portnox Cloud URL to which the application is supposed to redirect the user for authentication\nThe Portnox Cloud security certificate, so that the application can verify that it’s communicating with Portnox and not an intruder\nYou must also copy at least the following values from the application configuration screen to the Portnox Cloud configuration screen:\nThe application’s unique identifier, so that Portnox Cloud can identify it during communication\nThe application’s URL to which Portnox Cloud is supposed to redirect the user after successfully authenticating them\nThe process for OIDC applications is very similar and also involves only copying values across between Portnox Cloud and the application’s administration interface.\nIn the left-hand side menu, you will find examples for popular web applications."

You can use these logs to troubleshoot any issues with 802.1X.\nTo access Portnox Cloud AAA logs, click on the Troubleshooting option in the top menu.\nThen, click on the AAA LOGS option in the left-hand side menu.\nA screen appears with further options related to AAA logs.\nExample of AAA logs:\nNote: If the screen contains no logs, it means there were no AAA events in the last hour. By default, the screen displays only events from the last hour.\nTo load AAA logs from a specific time frame, click on the button next to the Change time frame label (by default, the button says Local: Last hour). Then, select the time frame in the pop-up window, and click on the Load logs button. \nTo expand all visible log entries and show more information, click on the Expand all button. \nThe entries in the list will be expanded, for example:\nTo refresh the list and load the latest events, click on the Refresh button. \nTo search for AAA logs related to a specific alert, copy the alert’s context ID and paste it in the Context ID field. \nYou can find the context ID of an alert by clicking on the Additional Info link under the alert on the Alerts screen. For example:\nTo export the logs to a text file, click on the Export button, select the time frame to export in the pop-up window, and then click on the Export button in the pop-up window. \nPortnox Cloud exports logs to a logs.txt file in the W3C extended log file format and your browser downloads the file to your default download directory.

  "text": "Preventive measures: What to do to avoid outages\nIn this topic, you will learn what preventive steps you can take to avoid disruption of your services secured by Portnox™ Cloud, if there are faults or outages.\nIf you use Portnox Cloud, your other business services such as networking or applications become dependent not just on Portnox Cloud, but also on your ISP and the connection to the Internet.\nIf you do not take any preventive measures, here is what can happen in case of temporary problems:\nIf you use Portnox Cloud to authenticate your users and devices onto your business networks, your users and devices may be unable to join networks secured by Portnox Cloud until the problem is fixed.\nIf you use Portnox Cloud for TACACS+, you may be unable to administer your network devices until the problem is fixed.\nIf you use Portnox Cloud for Zero Trust Network Access, your users may be unable to log on to your business applications until the problem is fixed.\nSuch temporary service disruptions may happen, for example, in the following circumstances:\nMost common: If there is an Internet outage, for example, if you lose connection to your ISP or if your ISP is experiencing problems.\nLess common: If there is a fault in the configuration, for example, if you delete an important file such as a certificate, or if you make a mistake when reconfiguring Portnox Cloud.\nVery rare: Due to problems with Portnox Cloud itself or the Microsoft Azure infrastructure.\nThe following are preventive measures that you can take to avoid the problems listed above:\nInstall a local RADIUS server\nThe Portnox Cloud local RADIUS server is a cache and a proxy to Portnox Cloud services. You run it on your premises, in a virtual machine or in a Docker container.\nFor the local RADIUS server to work as a preventive measure, you must configure your NAS devices to connect to the local RADIUS server as the primary server, because only then user information can be cached. If you configure your Cloud RADIUS servers as your primary servers, the local RADIUS server is not used as long as the Cloud RADIUS servers work, and so it has no cached data.\nAdvantages: \nAll your users and devices that authenticated to the network in the last 7 days will be able to authenticate for 7 days more without any connection to Cloud RADIUS servers.\nThis measure will be fully effective in case of Internet/ISP outages and Cloud/Azure outages.\nDisadvantages: \nNew users and devices, as well as those that did not authenticate in the last 7 days, will not be able to authenticate.\nThis measure will not be effective if the outage is caused by severe service disruption.\nThis measure will not be effective for Zero Trust Network Access.\nYou can install more than one local RADIUS server, for example, in different locations in your infrastructure.\nTo learn how to install and configure local RADIUS servers, see the following topics: Set up a local RADIUS server using a virtual machine and Run the local RADIUS server in a container.\nConfigure critical authentication on NAS devices\nMany modern NAS models offer functionality that is called critical auth VLAN, critical authentication, fallback VLAN, authserver timeout VLAN, auth service-unavailable VLAN, 802.1X authentication escape, or similar. All these functions mean the same thing: if for any reason your NAS device cannot reach the Portnox Cloud servers, you can decide that any current or new devices are automatically assigned to a specific VLAN, for example, to allow them access to the Internet but to keep your sensitive networks secure.\nAdvantages: \nAll your users and devices, no matter when they authenticated before, including new ones, will be assigned to the critical authentication VLAN and will be able to access services allowed by this VLAN’s configuration.\nThis measure will be fully effective in every case, including when the outage is caused by severe misconfiguration of Portnox Cloud.\nBecause the critical authentication VLAN is only accessible temporarily in the unlikely event of a service disruption, you can configure it to be the most permissive VLAN, allowing users to access all the things they might need during an outage.\nDisadvantages: \nYour users and devices will have the same access to all services permitted by the critical authentication VLAN, independent of what group these users are from, for example, both your marketing and IT departments would have the same permissions to the network.\nCritical authentication must be configured by your specialist network engineer on your equipment.\nNot all switch models and not all manufacturers offer such functionality.\nTo learn how to configure critical authentication, consult your switch documentation. We included as much information as we could in our configuration guides as well, see Configuring NAS devices for RADIUS access."

  "text": "About the monitoring mode\nIn this topic, you will learn what is the Portnox™ Cloud monitoring mode, how it works, and how to use it effectively.\nThe monitoring mode is a feature in Portnox Cloud that applies to NAS devices. You can turn it on either for a specific NAS device or for all newly connecting NAS devices. When monitoring mode is on for a specific NAS device, user devices trying to connect through that NAS will have access granted. However, if there are issues with the user device configuration, Cloud will still generate alerts to inform you of these problems. The alerts may appear as if Cloud denied access, but it actually granted it because the device is in monitoring mode.\nThink of monitoring mode as similar to having a global MAC bypass list. When a user device tries to authenticate using 802.1X and fails, Portnox Cloud checks if the device’s MAC address is on the bypass list. If it is, Cloud allows the device access to the network.\nHow to use monitoring mode\nWe recommend using monitoring mode when troubleshooting and when you can’t get user devices to connect. Since organizations often introduce Portnox Cloud directly into a production environment, even when you introduce it incrementally switch by switch, it may cause disruptions.\nHere’s how you can use monitoring mode effectively:\nStart by adding a NAS device accessed by a group of users who won’t be significantly affected if network connections temporarily fail.\nSet that NAS device to monitoring mode for a specific period, like 24 hours.\nGo to the Portnox Cloud Alerts screen and filter the alerts to show the NAS added in step 1.\nReview all displayed alerts for any issues that would prevent someone from connecting to the network.\nCorrect the issues that were discovered in the previous step.\nTurn off monitoring mode on the NAS.\nMove on to the next NAS device.\nIn urgent cases affecting the entire network, you can turn on the global monitoring mode and manually delete all NAS devices listed on the Devices screen. As soon as a user device tries to connect using any of your NAS devices, Portnox Cloud will automatically add these devices in monitoring mode, and all connections will be successful, letting you troubleshoot large-scale issues without impacting many users.\nConsiderations and warnings\nBe careful when using the global monitoring mode for extended periods, especially with Wi-Fi networks. In this mode, Portnox Cloud will let every device connect to the network, and these devices will be visible on the Devices screen. This can cause a large number of new and unknown devices, for example, if mobile phones use random MAC addresses for privacy. Additionally, anyone within your network’s range trying to connect, even if they are not part of your organization, will also be added to the Devices list and granted network access.\nA common issue with this scenario is that the number of devices increases rapidly, potentially exceeding the maximum number of devices allowed by your license. Once you exceed the license allowance, Portnox Cloud will block new devices. Devices that connected earlier, which are not essential or not associated with your organization, may cause legitimate devices to be unable to connect to the network."

  "text": "Testing Cloud RADIUS connectivity\nIn this topic, you will learn what you can do to test the connectivity between your devices and Portnox™ Cloud RADIUS servers.\nRecommended methods\nUse third-party applications for RADIUS server testing. You can use any such application you like, the following are our recommendations:\nNote: Use the correct IP, port, and secret value for the Cloud RADIUS server, but if you just need to test network connectivity, you ignore other fields such as user credentials.\nWindows: NTRadPing: free, GUI-based utility.\nmacOS: EAPTest: paid, GUI-based app.\nLinux: FreeRADIUS: open-source, contains a command-line utility radtest.\nCross-platform: RadPerf: free, command-line utility with packages for several operating systems.\nUnavailable methods\nThe following methods will not work:\nICMP Ping (Echo): Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers are hosted in Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft does not allow ICMP Echo Request or Echo Rely packets in Azure. If you try to ping the RADIUS server, you will get no answer. For the same reason, ICMP-based traceroute command will not work, either.\nUDP Echo: At the moment the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers do not respond to generic UDP requests, including UDP Echo.

  "text": "How to troubleshoot typical device onboarding issues\nIn this topic, you will learn how to address the most common issues when onboarding devices onto a network managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nIf you cannot connect your device to the network managed by Portnox Cloud, go to the Cloud portal, select Alerts in the top menu, and look at the most recent alerts. To make it easier to find relevant alerts, you can filter them by account name, NAS device, or other parameters. These alerts will inform you about the causes of authentication failures or will confirm successful authentication.\nHere are some typical reasons for connection failures:\nCheck if your group settings allow authentication with the selected method (credentials, certificates, etc.) for the network you’re trying to connect to. See the topic: Create a group.\nCheck if the account you are using is a member of the group that you have configured for the network you’re trying to connect to. See the topic: Manage members of a group.\nCheck if the number of devices per account, which is configured in group settings, has not been exceeded. For more information on setting this limit, see the topic: Edit and configure a group.\nCheck if the network in your group is set up to configure the correct authentication type. For example, if the user uses credentials and belongs to a Microsoft directory (Entra ID or AD), the group must be set up for MSCHAPv2 authentication. If the user uses credentials and belongs to a non-Microsoft directory like Google Workspace, the group must be set up for PAP authentication. If the user uses a certificate, the group must be set up for TLS authentication.\nIf you want to log in using credentials, your instance is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID, and your Entra ID access policy enforces multi-factor authentication (MFA), you need to set up a MFA bypass by following the steps in this topic: Bypass multi-factor authentication in Entra ID.\nIf you want to log in using credentials and your instance is integrated with Google Workspace, you must use an app password, not your regular password.\nIf certificate-based authentication does not work but credential-based authentication works, check if the packets are being fragmented by firewalls/routers between the NAS and the RADIUS server.\nIf you’re onboarding an Android or iOS device to a Wi-Fi network, make sure to turn off operating system features such as Use Private Address or Private Wi-Fi Address on iOS or Use randomized MAC on Android. Depending on the UEM and its configuration, and the access point and its configuration, MAC randomization may prevent network access.\nIf you’re trying to access the network without AgentP, but your account was previously activated with AgentP, check if the following setting is on: .\nIf your AgentP reports an error, see the following topic: How to collect AgentP logs for support"

  "text": "How to safely offboard from Portnox Cloud services\nIn this topic, you will find suggestions for safe offboarding from Portnox Cloud if you no longer want to use Cloud services and, instead, go back to an insecure network, or use a different product/service.\nWarning: Safe offboarding depends fully on how Portnox Cloud was implemented in your environment. Because only your internal network engineers and administrators know exactly how the product was configured, used, and maintained, we cannot provide definitive or exhaustive offboarding steps. You may not be using all the services or features listed here, or your setup may differ from standard practices. This list is intended solely as general guidance – it is your organization’s responsibility to evaluate and execute offboarding procedures appropriate to your unique deployment.\nEnsure that your devices can connect to networks and other services after offboarding: \nThe first and most critical step in offboarding is ensuring that your users retain access to your networks and resources. Before removing any Portnox-related components – such as integrations, certificates, virtual machines, or Docker containers – you must first confirm that all users can still connect to the networks and services that were previously secured with Portnox Cloud, or to replacement networks and services. This can be achieved either by transitioning to a replacement solution or, if necessary, by enabling access through less secure fallback configurations. Only once continuity of access is confirmed should you proceed with the removal of Portnox elements from your environment.\nIf you were using RADIUS/TACACS+, reconfigure your NAC devices. \nIf you were using Portnox Cloud RADIUS or TACACS+ services, removing Portnox configuration from your NAC devices – such as switches, access points, and VPNs – should be treated as a top priority. These devices must be reconfigured either to work with an alternative solution you plan to adopt or, if necessary, to operate in a less secure fallback mode (e.g., no port authorization on Ethernet ports, WPA2/WPA3 Personal SSIDs on access points, or local authentication and authorization for TACACS+).\nConsult your NAC device documentation to learn how to remove existing configurations and how to add new configurations for either your replacement solution or temporary less secure configurations. As a general guideline, on typical network switches you’ll want to:\nRemove any configured RADIUS or TACACS+ server entries related to Portnox Cloud.\nDisable or adjust 802.1X port-based authentication if it was enabled for Portnox Cloud.\nUpdate VLAN assignments or port security settings if they were tied to Portnox Cloud policies.\nFor wireless access points, common tasks include:\nRemoving RADIUS server settings and related authentication profiles.\nSwitching SSID security settings from Enterprise (802.1X) to Personal mode (WPA2/WPA3 Personal) if applicable.\nAdjusting certificate or client authentication settings that reference Portnox Cloud.\nSince exact steps vary by vendor and model, always refer to your specific device manuals or support resources to ensure proper configuration changes.\nIf you were using ZTNA, reconfigure all your resources/applications. \nIf you were using ZTNA for SSO-enabled web applications, each application must be reconfigured to stop relying on ZTNA for authentication. You can migrate to an alternative SSO provider, such as Entra ID or Google Workspace, or revert to using the application’s built-in login functionality. For any hosted applications that were accessed via ZTNA, external access will no longer be available once ZTNA is removed – unless you implement another remote access method, such as a VPN, to enable connectivity for remote users.\nIf you were using UEM/MDM solutions, push new profiles. \nIf you integrated Portnox with a UEM/MDM solution such as Microsoft Intune or Jamf, it’s essential to review and update any enforced configurations for client devices. These configurations must no longer direct devices to use Portnox RADIUS services, Portnox-issued certificates, or any other Portnox Cloud components. You will need to push new configurations to client devices that align with your replacement solution, or, if applicable, allow devices to connect to fallback networks using less secure methods (e.g., WPA2/WPA3 Personal SSIDs, third-party guest network, etc.).\nReconfigure your client devices. \nIf some or all of your client devices were not managed through a UEM/MDM solution, you’ll need to manually update their network configurations, including setting up network interfaces, Wi-Fi profiles, or other relevant settings to connect to your new solution or, if necessary, to less secure fallback networks such as WPA2/WPA3 Personal SSIDs. This also applies if your client device network adapters were configured using AgentP.\nRemove integrations with Portnox Cloud. \nDuring your initial onboarding with Portnox Cloud, it’s likely that you integrated it with other systems – such as authentication providers (e.g., Entra ID, Google Workspace, Okta), UEM/MDM solutions (e.g., Intune, Jamf), SIEM platforms, and others. While removing these integrations is not required for maintaining network access or service continuity, and they will cease functioning once your Portnox Cloud tenant is decommissioned, it is strongly recommended to clean them up as part of good housekeeping and to avoid unnecessary clutter or confusion in your environment.\nThe exact steps for removing these integrations will vary depending on the specific solutions involved. For example, in Azure, you should remove any Portnox-related applications from your Entra ID tenant. In SIEM platforms, you may need to delete configured log sources and any associated resources, such as virtual machines or syslog forwarders. Refer to the documentation of each integrated product to ensure all Portnox-related components are properly removed.\nRemove Portnox virtual machines, Docker containers, and LDAP Broker instances. \nYou may have virtual machines or Docker containers running Portnox-related services – such as local RADIUS, local TACACS+, ZTNA, or components used for integrations like SIEM – hosted either in your physical infrastructure or in a cloud environment. You may also have LDAP Broker services running in the background on local virtual or physical machines. Be sure to identify, stop, and remove all such instances.\nWhile these services will no longer function once your Portnox Cloud tenant is decommissioned, they may still consume resources. If they are cloud-hosted, you may continue to incur charges; if they are running locally, they will continue to occupy system resources unnecessarily.\nIf you are using cloud platforms, also remove any additional services that were provisioned specifically for Portnox Cloud – for example, in Azure, remove virtual networks, public IP addresses, log configurations, and other related infrastructure components that were created to support container instances running Portnox Docker containers.\nRemove AgentP from client devices. \nIf your devices were previously managed using AgentP, you should uninstall AgentP. While AgentP will stop functioning once your tenant is decommissioned and poses no security risk if left installed, it is recommended to uninstall it for housekeeping purposes and to free up disk space and reduce clutter.\nRemove Portnox supplicant certificates from client devices. \nIf you issued Portnox certificates to client devices – whether distributed manually, via a UEM/MDM solution through SCEP, or through self-onboarding – you can now remove them as part of housekeeping. When your Portnox Cloud tenant is decommissioned, the tenant’s Certificate Authority (CA) will no longer exist, causing all issued certificates to stop working completely. Although these certificates pose no risk if left on devices, they are unnecessary and it’s best to remove them. There is no need to revoke any supplicant certificates, since without the CA, the certificates become invalid automatically.\nRemove the Portnox tenant CA certificate from client devices, if present in the root certificates category, as it will no longer be valid or needed once the tenant is decommissioned. However, do not remove the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 certificate, the G2 certificate, or any other industry-standard CA certificates used to sign a wide range of certificates beyond Portnox. Removing these trusted root certificates may impact access to other services and cause broader connectivity or trust issues in your environment.\nDecommission your Portnox Cloud tenant. \nAs the last step, coordinate with your Portnox contact to request the decommissioning and deletion of your tenant. Keep in mind that tenant deletion is permanent – if you choose to return to Portnox Cloud in the future, you will need to create a new tenant and begin the onboarding process from the beginning."

  "text": "Security architecture and principles\nPortnox Cloud protects all data traveling from various Portnox Cloud components to and from the Portnox Cloud services, based on the following security principle: \nWith 802.1X implementation, Portnox Cloud supports only secure EAP authentication methods: TLS/TTLS and PEAP-MSCHAPv2. With potential implementation of RadSec or RADIUS proxy, any type of RADIUS communication goes inside an additional TLS-wrapped transport layer which serves as best protection from potential attacks like MITM. Portnox Cloud services use an authorization model for allowing any access, data extraction, or data submission from any Portnox Cloud or third-party components (API calls). The authorization model is based on periodically rotated API tokens that are presented by the service caller in any request. There are no anonymous calls, session management, trusted IP caches, or any other well-known techniques that jeopardize data-in-motion security; and any data submission or fetching request from Portnox Cloud components is re-authenticated and authorized anew. \nPortnox LDAP Broker\nPortnox LDAP Broker is a software application that runs on-premises on the customer network and acts as a mediator between the Portnox Cloud services and the customer’s corporate directory services (Active Directory or OpenLDAP). \nSince Active Directory users and groups are among an organization’s most valuable information, extra security measures are taken to safeguard that information: \nPortnox LDAP Broker must be installed on a Domain member server, Windows 2008 server and above (it can also be installed on the AD Domain controller).\nPortnox LDAP Broker connects to the domain controller with a domain account that has read-only access on the organizational Active Directory. \nPortnox LDAP Broker can connect to the organizational Active Directory using the LDAP or SLDAP (Secure LDAP) protocols, according to the customer’s preference.\nPortnox LDAP Broker connects to the Portnox Cloud service using outbound TCP ports 8081 and 443. Cloud traffic is always initiated by the Portnox LDAP Broker. \nPortnox LDAP Broker communicates with the Portnox Cloud services over TLS. All traffic between the Portnox LDAP Broker and the Portnox Cloud services is encrypted. \nPortnox LDAP Broker updates the Portnox Cloud service only with directory users and groups. User authentication is performed by utilizing the MS-CHAP-V2 challenge/response protocol (password doesn’t travel within the TLS encrypted tunnels, only the challenge/response hashes) or in plain text format but within the TLS encrypted tunnels (in case of enrollment or PAP RADIUS authentication attempt). \nExternal repositories\nPortnox Cloud supports several external repositories which are used to authenticate users to network and to enroll AgentP (via Portnox Cloud or federated SSO): Azure, Google Workspace, Okta.\nCommunication between Portnox Cloud, the user, and external repositories uses best security practices to provide full protection for user data:\nAll inter-service communication uses TLS tunnels so traffic between services is encrypted.\nIn case of Azure Directory Domain Services integration, Portnox LDAP Broker is installed inside the organization tenant, which provides additional security control for the organization itself. \nAll requests to the user repository are made using read-only access without any changes on customer federation provider side.\nFederated enrollment or on-boarding authentication process is fully handled by identity provider with all setup policies (like MFA). \nWireless controllers and Ethernet switches\nWireless controllers and Ethernet switches send RADIUS authentication requests to the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server, to perform validation and allow access of endpoint devices with the Portnox AgentP installed or agentless devices. The following security measurements are taken to ensure secure communication between the organizational network equipment and Portnox Cloud RADIUS in the cloud:\nAll RADIUS packets use a shared secret as key to encrypt sensitive data.\nRadSec is a new approach for RADIUS communication with the best level of security, as it works fully inside a TLS tunnel and uses the PEAP-MSCAPv2, EAP-TLS, and EAP-TTLS protocols. The TLS tunnel is used only for sensitive data, such as passwords and hashes. All common RADIUS attributes, like Calling- Station-Id, are transferred outside of the TLS tunnel. \nIn the case of MSCHAPv2, the end-user credentials never travel across networks. Instead, only the challenge/response hashes travel, enabling Portnox Cloud to reliably validate user credentials without knowing them, by using the organization’s authentication repository.\nPortnox Cloud guest management for wireless networks\nWith Portnox Cloud guest management for wireless networks, Portnox Cloud uses the built-in captive portal capabilities of each supported wireless controller vendor.\nPortnox Cloud replaces the following vendor-specific components as follows:\nReplaces the original vendor captive portal web page with the Portnox Cloud web pages\nReplaces the AAA server with the Portnox Cloud RADIUS\nReplaces the user repository with the Portnox Cloud guest management repository\nThe Portnox Cloud captive portal can be accessed only via HTTPS/SSL, unlike some vendor solutions that allow plain unencrypted HTTP access.\nGuest credentials are sent to the wireless controller using SSL. The controller then authenticates them against the Portnox Cloud RADIUS.\nWith this architecture, traffic between the wireless controller and the Portnox Cloud RADIUS could be secured by different authentication protocols, RadSec (fully inside a TLS tunnel), PEAP-MSCHAPv2, or PEAP-CHAP where only credentials are placed inside the TLS tunnel.\nVPN gateways\nPortnox Cloud can be used to authenticate VPN users using two-factor authentication, with the second factor being a strong factor. Portnox Cloud can also add an additional layer of security for users connecting remotely via VPN with the VPN gateway using the Cloud RADIUS service as an authentication authority. \nThe connection security type, tunnel encryption, and challenge/response protocol are determined exclusively by the VPN terminator itself.\nThe Portnox Cloud RADIUS service supports the highest and strongest secure connection type available today by VPN terminator vendors: the PEAP protocols family, which uses a TLS tunnel for critical data with MS-CHAP-V2 or CHAP authentication protocols inside, and even PAP, which is secured only by the RADIUS protocol level (shared secret).\nPortnox local RADIUS\nThe Portnox local RADIUS is a software application that runs on-premises on the customer network, and acts as RADIUS services to perform authentication from on-premises. It also contains cache of authentication data for the last 7 days to authenticate devices when connection to Internet cannot be established. \nPortnox Cloud local RADIUS provides the following methods to secure authentication data: \nThe Portnox Cloud local RADIUS connects to the cloud service using the outbound 443 TCP port. Cloud traffic is always initiated by the local RADIUS. \nThe Portnox Cloud local RADIUS communicates with the Portnox Cloud services over TLS. All traffic between the Portnox Cloud local RADIUS and the Portnox Cloud services is encrypted.\nCommunication between the NAS and the Portnox Cloud local RADIUS is the same as for Cloud RADIUS but happens inside on-premises network, so all data is also protected the security department of the organization."

  "text": "Create a site\nIn this topic, you will learn how to create a site in Portnox™ Cloud.\nA site in Portnox Cloud represents a physical location, such as an office, where a specific NAS device is located.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Devices option. \nIn the top left, click on the NETWORK tab. \nIn the bottom left, click on the Manage sites button. \nYour browser will show your site tree.\nNote: There is always a default root site that cannot be removed. Initially, it is named like your Portnox Cloud account and contains all your NAS devices.\nTo add a site, click on the parent site, and then click on the + button in the top right. \nIf you don’t click on a parent site, the new site will be added into the hierarchy under the root site.\nIn the Site name field, enter the name for the site, and in the Description field, enter an optional description. \nIn the Connect to site field, select the parent site from the list of available sites. \nA parent site is mandatory. Initially, only the root site is available.\nIn the NAS Assignment section, click on the Add NAS assignment link to define a range of IP addresses. \nIf a NAS device that connects to Portnox Cloud has an external IP address that matches the range selected for this site, Cloud will assign it to this site.\nImportant: This automatic assignment will only work the first time a device authenticates using this NAS. If the NAS is already added to Portnox Cloud because some device already authenticated using this NAS, the Cloud will show the old site assignment. To change the NAS’s site assignment, delete the NAS from the Cloud and then authenticate using this NAS again.\nIn the CREATE NEW NAS ASSIGNMENT window, choose CIDR or IP Range to define the range of addresses. \nIf you select CIDR, enter the base address in the IP Address field and the bit suffix in the Prefix field.\nImportant: Do not enter a full CIDR-format address in the IP Address field. Do not leave the value 0 in the Prefix field if you want to define a single IP address for a site – in such case, the bit suffix value should be 32.\nIf you select IP Range, enter the From and To IP addresses.\nClick on the Save button to close the window and save the IP range. \nIf you want to add more IP address ranges, click on the Add NAS assignment link again and repeat the above steps. \nThe NETWORK RANGE/IP table contains the network ranges to identify your NAS devices as belonging to this site.\nAlternatively, click on the Import NAS assignments link to import a list of IP address ranges. \nThe list of ranges for one site must be in a text file. Each line of the file must define a single range. You can define the range in a CIDR format (x.x.x.x/y) or in an IP range format (x.x.x.x-y.y.y.y).\nOptional: Declare the access control policy to assign to this site. \nAt this stage, assigning an access control policy is optional. You can do it later when creating or managing access control policies. For more information about creating access control policies, see the following topic: Create or edit an access control policy.\nClick on the Select policy field to see a list of available access control policies and select one. \nClick on the Automatically apply chosen policy to all nested sites checkbox to activate it. \nIf this setting is turned on, all sites added to the tree below this site will automatically have the same access control policy.\nTo save your settings, click on the Save button in the top right corner. \nResult: Your site hierarchy will be updated with your new site.\nYou can add more, edit, or delete sites by using the buttons in the top right.

  "text": "Create or edit an access control policy\nIn this topic, you will learn how to create and assign an access control policy in Portnox™ Cloud.\nTo understand what are policies in Portnox Cloud, what types of policies are available, and how they work together with accounts and groups, read the following topic: What are policies in Portnox Cloud?.\nNote: The System Default Policy is tuned to meet the requirements of most configurations. When testing or initially deploying Portnox Cloud, you can skip this topic and keep the default settings. The System Default Policy is assigned to all groups, unless you create another policy and assign it manually.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Policies option. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the Create policy button to create a new policy. \nNote: You can also edit an existing policy by clicking on the ✎ icon on the right-hand side of the selected line that represents the policy. The creation and editing processes are almost the same.\nIn the Access Control Policy Name field, enter the name for the new policy and in the field below, enter an optional description. \nIf you’re editing the System Default Policy, you cannot change its name.\nOn the left-hand side, click on the Wireless (Network) option to configure policy rules for wireless networks. \nEach policy contains rules for all three network types as well as for applications. If you do not configure a specific type, Portnox Cloud will use default settings for that type.\nIn the SUCCESSFUL AUTHENTICATION tab, define the rules for successful authentication for wireless networks: \nThese rules will apply if the device authenticates successfully with Portnox Cloud and gains access to the network.\nIn the VLAN SETTINGS section, optionally activate the Quarantine devices in a specific VLAN switch. \nIf this setting is not turned on, the device will be assigned to the default VLAN for that interface or wireless network. If this setting is turned on, you can either select a VLAN ID or VLAN name, and the NAS will assign the device to the selected VLAN.\nNote: We recommend that you use the VLAN name if the VLAN ID is inconsistent across different sites, for example, when in one office the Sales VLAN has ID 7, and in another office the Sales vlan has ID 42.\nIn the ACCESS CONTROL LIST SETTINGS section, optionally activate the Assign authenticated devices to a specific Access Control List (ACL) switch. \nIf this setting is not turned on, the device will have access to the network without being assigned to any ACLs. If this setting is turned on, you can either select an existing ACL rule ID (the rule is defined on the NAC device and simply referred to by its ID), the DACL Policy Builder to create rules one by one, or Custom DACL to paste an existing DACL that you have defined somewhere else.\nIf you selected DACL Policy Builder in the previous step, click on the Add new rule link to create a new rule. \nImportant: Only NAS devices that support dACLs (downloadable ACLs) can execute custom ACL rules. While most professional NAS devices support this technology, there are notable exceptions. Check your NAS device documentation for information about dACL support. \nPortnox Cloud supports the following vendors for downloadable ACLs:\nAruba\nBrocade\nCisco\nHP\nHuawei\nJuniper\nRuckus\nFor an example of how to create dACLs on a Cisco switch using the Policy Builder, see the following topic: Create a downloadable access control list (dACL) on a Cisco switch using the Policy Builder.\nIf you use devices that do not support dACLs, for example, Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and Wireless Service Modules (WiSMs), you need to create the ACL on the device and refer to that ACL using the ACL rule ID.\nIn the Action field, select whether this rule will Deny or Permit packets that match the rule.\nIn the Protocol field, select the protocol that this rule applies to: TCP, UDP, or Any.\nIn the Source IP or IP/Range field, enter the source IP address or the source IP address in the CIDR format or leave the field empty to match all source IP addresses.\nIn the Source port field, enter the source port number or leave the field empty to match all source port numbers.\nIn the Destination IP or IP/Range field, enter the destination IP address or the destination IP address in the CIDR format or leave the field empty to match all destination IP addresses.\nIn the Destination port field, enter the destination port number or leave the field empty to match all destination port numbers.\nClick on the Confirm button to save the rule. Add more rules using the Add new rule link (maximum 65 rules) or edit/remove existing rules using Edit or Remove links on the right-hand side of a selected rule.\nIf you selected Custom DACL in the previous step, in the Attribute name field, select the attribute name relevant to your NAS device, and in the text area below, paste your existing dACL. \nFor example:\nNote: The Custom DACL option supports up to 65 lines.\nIn the AUTHENTICATION VIOLATION tab, define the rules for authentication violation for wireless networks: \nThese rules will apply if the device fails to authenticate with Portnox Cloud for any reason.\nIn the VLAN SETTINGS section, select the action to be taken upon authentication violation: \nDeny access: The NAS will deny the device access to the network.\nQuarantine devices in a specific VLAN: The NAS will allow the device to access the network but will assign the device to a specific VLAN.\nIf you selected the Quarantine devices in a specific VLAN, follow the instructions as described for the SUCCESSFUL AUTHENTICATION tab. \nIn the RISK POLICY VIOLATION tab, define the rules for risk policy violation for wireless networks. The configuration process is identical to the one for the AUTHENTICATION VIOLATION tab. \nThese rules will apply if the device fails the assigned risk assessment policy. To create or edit a risk policy, see the following topic: Create or edit a risk assessment policy.\nIn the BLOCKED BY ADMIN tab, define the rules for when the wireless device is blocked by the administrator. The configuration process is identical to the one for the AUTHENTICATION VIOLATION tab. \nThese rules will apply if the Portnox Cloud administrator manually blocks the device on the Devices screen.\nIn the left-hand side menu, select the Wired (Network) option and repeat the steps above for wired networks. \nThe configuration options for wired networks are identical to those for wireless networks.\nIn the left-hand side menu, select the VPN (Network) option and repeat the following steps for all tabs: SUCCESSFUL AUTHENTICATION, AUTHENTICATION VIOLATION, RISK POLICY VIOLATION, and BLOCKED BY ADMIN: \nThe configuration options for VPNs are identical for all four tabs.\nClick on the Assign VPN-connected devices to a Group policy switch to activate it. \nThis setting applies to Windows Group Policies on the VPN server. If this setting is not turned on, VPN-connected devices will be assigned to the default Group Policy. If this setting is turned on, you can select the Group Policy to assign the device to.\nIn the Policy name field, enter the name of the Group Policy. \nImportant: In this context, the term group policy refers to the Cisco definition, as outlined in Cisco documentation, rather than the more popular Microsoft interpretation of group policy: A group policy is a set of user-oriented attribute/value pairs for IPSec connections that are stored either internally (locally) on the device or externally on a RADIUS server.\nIf you’re creating an access control policy for application access, select a relevant option in the RISK POLICY VIOLATION tab. \nApplication access control policies are used only by the Portnox Zero Trust Network Access functionality, and in such policies, there are no network-related settings. The policy is there only to decide the action that Zero Trust Network Access takes if the user device does not meet the risk assessment policy requirements.\nDeny access: If the user device is evaluated as unsafe by the risk assessment policy requirements, Zero Trust Network Access does not allow the user to access to the application, displaying a standard message that directs the user to Portnox documentation.\nDeny access and display message: As in the above option, but you can specify a message to display. For example, you can provide contact details for your users, or a link to your local documentation.\nDeny access and redirect user to a given URL: As in the first option, but you can automatically redirect the user to any URL, for example, your local documentation pages for troubleshooting or contact information.\nAlways allow access: This setting is only recommended for testing in a monitoring mode. Zero Trust Network Access will allow the user to access the application even if the device is evaluated as unsafe by the risk assessment policy.\nThe Advanced settings section lets you choose between two options of how to handle the situation when the user ID presented in the certificate does not match the user ID in the identity provider:\nDeny access: We recommend using this option for enhanced security. If there is a user mismatch between the identity provider and the certificate, the user will be denied access. This is the default setting.\nAllow access: Use this option only if you use shared accounts, which we do not recommend for security reasons.\nTo save your policy settings, click on the Save button on the bottom right of the page. \nResult: You created or edited an access control policy. You can now assign this policy to groups.\nTo assign policies to groups, see the following topic: Assign policies to a group.\nImportant: If you change the VLAN/ACL assignments of a policy that is already used by devices, these changes do not apply immediately, but only after the device disconnects and reconnects to the network. This is because only then the device will receive the new assignments from the RADIUS server. However, you can force such a disconnect by using the RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA) feature. To learn more about how to set up your environment to support RADIUS CoA, see the following topic: Enable the RADIUS Change of Authorization feature."

  "text": "Configure a guest Wi-Fi network\nIn this topic, you will learn how to configure a guest Wi-Fi network in Portnox™ Cloud using a captive portal.\nNote: The Portnox Cloud guest Wi-Fi network works with the Cloud RADIUS servers. To create your own Cloud RADIUS instance, follow the instructions in the following topic: Create Cloud RADIUS servers.\nThe guest Wi-Fi network is a separate Wi-Fi network with a unique SSID, which lets guests of your organization access the Internet and limited local resources with no connection to the corporate network. When a guest connects to your guest Wi-Fi network using a shared password or no password, they can be redirected to a captive portal. After they complete the steps in the captive portal, the Wi-Fi access point connects them to the Internet and selected local resources.\nMost Wi-Fi controllers allow you to create a guest network and let you create a simple captive portal managed by the controller. The Portnox Cloud captive portal gives you some unique choices such as the ability for organization employees to authorize guests. This is possible, because it works together with the RADIUS server.\nThere is no universal standard or protocol for captive portals. The Portnox Cloud captive portal works only with the following network controllers and their internal standards:\nCisco Meraki\nCisco\nHPE Aruba\nRUCKUS Networks\nJuniper Mist\nExtreme WiNG\nAerohive (legacy, now Extreme)\nFortinet\nUbiquiti UniFi\nWatchGuard\nImportant: The guest network and the Cloud-managed employee network cannot use the same SSID. If you already have the SSID configured or referenced in one of the Portnox Cloud group settings, you will encounter the following error when trying to access the captive portal on the same SSID: Cannot proceed due to next errors: Access denied.\nTo set up a Portnox Cloud guest Wi-Fi network, follow these steps.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the heading. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the Add a captive portal service link to add a new captive portal. \nImportant: You can create a maximum of 10 captive portals in Portnox Cloud. If you try to add more, you will encounter an error.\nIn the URL field, enter a unique suffix that will identify this captive portal. \nAll your captive portal URLs have a similar format: https://guests.portnox.com/your_organization_identifier/suffix , where your_organization_identifier is a unique string of characters generated for your organization by Portnox Cloud, and suffix is the value of this field.\nIn this example, we used the suffix homeworld but you can use any suffix you like.\nIn the Authentication type field, select the type of authentication that users will be asked for when connecting to the captive portal. \nPortnox Cloud Guest: Only guests manually added by the Portnox Cloud administrator () can authenticate. The administrator receives the credentials via email and needs to manually deliver them to the guest user.\nNo authentication (disclaimer only): Guests do not need to authenticate, only accept the disclaimer or terms of service.\nSponsored Guest: Guests are asked to provide an email address of a sponsor from the organization. Once confirmed, they can create a password for further access. Portnox Cloud administrators can configure a password policy for these passwords.\nThe sponsor receives an email request to confirm.\nIf the sponsor confirms, the guest receives a one-time passcode valid for 2 hours, and can enter the guest network upon first setting up their password.\nSMS authentication: Guests enter their mobile number and then receive a code sent to this number via a text message (SMS). This code lets them set their password and join the guest network.\nIn the Dynamic session timeout field, select the period after which the guest session expires. \nWhile the session is active, if the guest connects to the guest Wi-Fi network again, they won’t need to provide their credentials (if required) again. After the session expires, if the guest is still connected, they will be disconnected. To reconnect, they must access the captive portal again and provide credentials (if required).\nImportant: Dynamic session timeout defines how long a guest account remains valid in Portnox Cloud. Once this period ends, the account is deleted from the Portnox guest network configuration. However, some NAS devices may still cache the guest’s authorization, allowing them to reconnect to the captive portal SSID even after expiration. \nFor Mist, WatchGuard, and UniFi NAS devices, Portnox Cloud can automatically sync the expiration time with the device, preventing this issue. For other NAS devices, you’ll need to manually configure the session expiration in the NAS settings to match the value set in Portnox Cloud. Refer to your NAS documentation for guidance.\nIn the Disclaimer (“Acceptable Use” statement): field, enter any formatted text that you want the users to be asked to accept before they connect to the guest Wi-Fi network. \nIn the Logo field, click on the Portnox™ Cloud logo to replace it with your own logo or click on the 🗑 icon to show no logo in your captive portal. \nClick on the Save button to save your changes and generate a URL and an IP for your captive portal. \nIn the Captive Portal URL field, click on the ⧉ icon to copy the unique URL of your captive portal. \nSave this value, for example, in a text file. You will need to enter this value in the configuration of your network controller. Refer to your network controller documentation for specific instructions.\nNote: This value is displayed only after saving the configuration of the captive portal.\nIn the IP (for walled garden) field, copy the IP addresses of the captive portal. \nSave these values, for example, in a text file. You will need to enter these IP addresses in the configuration of your network controller as a walled garden. This means: the IP addresses that the guest can connect to before they authenticate in the captive portal. If not, the guest device will not be able to access the captive portal.\nNote: This value is displayed only after saving the configuration of the captive portal.\nIn the Shared Secret field, enter the shared secret specific for the controller. \nRuckus: Enter the NBI password generated in Ruckus ZoneDirector.\nMist: Enter the API secret value from the guest portal configuration in the Mist management console.\nWatchGuard: Enter the shared secret that you entered or will enter in the WatchGuard XTM.\nFor other brands of controllers, you do not need to enter a shared secret.\nResult: You have added a captive portal service.\nNote: The guest Wi-Fi captive portal imposes a daily restriction on the number of new guests, determined by your Portnox license. You have the option to expand this limit by purchasing additional packages (for details, see our pricing page). The user count resets on midnight, based on the time zone configured for the tenant. \nPortnox Cloud counts the number of concurrently connected guests devices. If a device remains connected, the count will be reduced by one on the following day. However, if a guest device gets disconnected, and if the duration of the previous connection has not exceeded the value specified in the Session Expiration property, the next connection from the same device will be allowed without authentication in the Captive Portal. Otherwise, the connection will be counted as a new device, so the count will increase by one.\nFor specific instructions on setting up guest Wi-Fi access on specific network controllers, see the following topic: Configure wireless devices to work with Portnox Cloud."

  "text": "Configure Ethernet devices to work with Portnox Cloud\nIn this collection of documents, you will find specific instructions for configuring Ethernet-based NAS devices to access the Portnox™ Cloud RADIUS servers and provide AAA services.\nImportant: The instructions for setting up third-party devices may change when the manufacturers update their firmware or release new models. To get the most accurate and current configuration guidance, please refer to the documentation provided by the manufacturer.\nIf your manufacturer or device is not listed in the left-hand side menu, here are general instructions how to configure most Ethernet switches for 802.1X with Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers. Most switches are configured using commands, not a graphical user interface.\nConfigure the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers. \nCreate or edit a group so that it supports wired access. \nThis step is necessary so that Portnox Cloud can manage network access. If you skip this step, you will not be able to authenticate, even if you configure your switch properly.\nFor information on how to configure Cloud groups, see the following topic: Create a group.\nAdd Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers to the switch configuration. \nTo complete this step, you will need your specific IP addresses, port numbers, and secret keys that you obtained in the previous step. You can add just one server (for example, the US server only) or both of them (US and EU), but this may be limited by the choice you made when you created your Portnox tenant.\nIn this step, you can also add the local RADIUS proxy, which will be used to authenticate current clients in case of an Internet outage. You should add it using your local IP address and the port numbers and secret key that you obtained in the previous step.\nCommands used by different switches to add RADIUS servers could look like this (we’re providing this so it’s easier for you to search in your vendor’s documentation):\nradius-server name address ipv4 ip_address auth-port auth port acct-port acct port key secret key\nradius-server host ip_address auth-port auth port acct-port acct port key secret key\nradius-server host ip_address auth-port auth port acct-port acct port key 0 secret key\nradius-server host ip_address auth-port auth port acct-port acct port default key secret key\nset radius-server ip_address port auth port secret secret key\nConfigure RADIUS authentication on the switch and optionally MAC address bypass (MAB) authentication. \nThe process to configure RADIUS authentication for your switch is very specific, but it usually includes commands to globally enable 802.1X authentication, 802.1X accounting, and optionally MAC address bypass authentication as well as the definition of VLANs that devices will be assigned to if they successfully authenticate or fail authentication.\nMAC address bypass authentication is needed only if you must authenticate some of your devices, for example, IoT devices, using only their MAC addresses.\nCommands used by different switches to enable 802.1X authentication and accounting could look like this:\ndot1x enable\naaa authentication port-access eap-radius\naaa authentication dot1x default group group_name\naaa accounting dot1x default start-stop radius\nset protocols dot1x authenticator auth_group servers_group\nConfigure the switch ports/interfaces for RADIUS authentication and optionally MAC address authentication. \nIn this step, you decide which ports or interfaces on your switch should be used for client devices. You can set these ports/interfaces to authenticate devices using RADIUS and/or using MAC addresses. Usually, you are able to provide a range of ports to configure at the same time or configure ports one by one as needed.\nCommands used by different switches to configure interfaces/ports could look like this:\ninterface interface_name\nauthentication port-control auto\nmab\ninterface interface_name\naaa authentication port-access auth-precedence dot1x mac-auth\naaa authentication port-access dot1x authenticator\nenable\naaa authentication port-access mac-auth\nenable\ninterface range interface_range\ndot1x authentication\ndot1x port-control auto\ndot1x mac-auth-bypass\naaa port-access authenticator port_range\naaa port-access mac-based port_range\nConfigure the critical authentication process on the switch. \nMany modern switch models offer functionality that is called critical auth VLAN, critical authentication, fallback VLAN, authserver timeout vlan, auth service-unavailable VLAN, 802.1X authentication escape or similar. All these functions mean one thing: if for any reason your switch cannot reach the Portnox Cloud servers, you can decide that any current or new devices are automatically assigned to a specific VLAN, for example, to allow them access to the Internet but to keep your sensitive networks secure.\nNote: While this is not a necessary step, we strongly encourage you to see if your switch supports such functionality. This will prevent your clients from being completely denied access to the network in case of an external outage.\nCommands used by different switches to enable a critical VLAN could look like this:\ninterface interface_name\nauthentication event server dead action authorize vlan vlan_number\naaa port-access interface_name critical-auth-data-vlan vlan_number\ninterface range interface_range dot1x critical-vlan vlan_number\nset interface interface_name server-fail vlan_number"

  "text": "Configure wireless captive portals to work with Portnox Cloud\nIn this collection of documents, you will find specific instructions for configuring captive portals on wireless NAS devices to work with the Portnox™ Cloud guest network.\nYou can use captive portals with wireless NAS devices and Portnox Cloud in two ways: with guests managed by Cloud, or with guests managed by the NAS.\nTo learn more about configuring guest access in Portnox Cloud, read the following topic: Configure a guest Wi-Fi network.\nGuests managed by Portnox Cloud\nThe guest user connects to the guest SSID on the NAS.\nThe guest’s device recognizes a captive portal and opens the guest’s browser.\nThe guest’s browser opens a web page served by the NAS device’s internal web server.\nThe NAS device’s internal web server redirects the guest’s browser to a URL managed by Portnox Cloud. This is usually either a meta-refresh or a 30x error redirect.\nPortnox Cloud manages the guest’s access according to Portnox guest network settings. For example: the guest might receive credentials via a text message or ask an employee (sponsor) to vouch for them.\nIf the guest successfully authenticates based on the guest requirements, the Portnox Cloud back-end registers this in the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server.\nThe guest’s browser is redirected back to a success URL, which the NAS device recognizes as confirmation of successful authorization.\nThe NAS device validates this fact using the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server.\nThe guest is granted access to the network.\nNote: This is a recommended approach. All the topics in this collection describe this type of configuration.\nThere are several advantages of this approach:\nGuests and employees are managed using a single platform (Portnox Cloud), providing greater flexibility, security, and scalability.\nGuest management is platform-independent. You can manage multiple captive portals together, regardless of the NAS devices running the guest SSIDs.\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that Portnox Cloud supports it only for the following NAS device manufacturers: Cisco, Cisco Meraki, Aruba, Ruckus, Mist, Extreme Wing, Fortinet, Aerohive (legacy), WatchGuard, and Ubiquiti UniFi. Other captive portals are currently not supported because there is no standard for captive portal integration with third parties. Each manufacturer’s captive portal interacts differently with third-party URLs and RADIUS servers, requiring custom integration for each manufacturer.\nGuests managed by the internal NAS engine\nThe guest user connects to the guest SSID. The guest’s device recognizes a captive portal and opens the guest’s browser.\nThe NAS device directs the user to a URL controlled by the NAS device’s internal captive portal engine.\nThe NAS device manages the user’s access according to its internal settings. Access options depend on the functionality of the NAS device’s captive portal engine.\nIn this approach, there is no involvement of Portnox Cloud. Guests can be managed fully by the NAS device without any Portnox Cloud involvement. However, you can use Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers to authenticate users if you want to use the captive portal for authenticated users, not just for guests.\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that each captive portal must be configured and managed independently, which consumes valuable human resources and makes unified security management much more difficult, especially for larger organizations. We recommend this approach only if Portnox Cloud does not support your manufacturer’s NAS equipment."

  "text": "What are accounts, groups, policies, and sites?\nIn this topic, you will learn what we mean by accounts, groups, policies, and sites in Portnox™ Cloud.\nWhat are accounts in Portnox Cloud?\nAn account in Portnox Cloud represents a person or device that needs access to the network.\nNote: Do not confuse the term account with the term Portnox account, which is a specific type of account in Portnox Cloud. Also, do not confuse the term account with the term Portnox ID, which represents the credentials that the user uses to access an account in Portnox Cloud.\nFor devices that are used directly by people, such as computers or mobile phones, it makes sense to control network access for the person, not the device. In such case, you can create an account for the person, and the person can use the account credentials to log in using different devices.\nFor devices that run automatically, such as printers, scanners, IP cameras, and other IoT devices, it makes sense to control network access for the device, not any particular person. In such case, you can create an account for the device. \nNote: You can create an account for a group of similar devices, for example, a group of printers, but individual device accounts are recommended for more granular control.\nAccount types\nPortnox account\nIf you don’t use any authentication repositories such as Entra ID, Google Workspace, Okta, Active Directory, or OpenLDAP, you can use Portnox Cloud to keep a list of your users and groups, and manage them. In such cases, you create Portnox accounts for each user, based on their corporate email address.\nLDAP account\nIf you use an external authentication repository, you can create an account in Portnox Cloud that is linked to the LDAP user from that repository.\nContractor account\nIf you need to let contractors access your network, and you cannot create Portnox accounts for them because they don’t have a corporate email address, you can create a contractor account based on any email address and a password.\nMAC-based account\nIf you have devices that do not support 802.1X authentication and cannot provide any user credentials to the cloud RADIUS server, you can create accounts for such devices linked to their MAC addresses. The MAC address is treated as the identifier that such devices use to access the network.\nNote: We recommend that you do not create MAC-based accounts for devices that support the 802.1X protocol, and that are used by people, because it lets anyone with access to such a device access the company network.\nDevice-type account\nIf you do not want to create individual MAC-based accounts because there are a lot of unmanned devices that need access to your network, you can create a device-type account. For example, you can create an account for all devices of a specific type, from a specific manufacturer, with a model name that contains a specific string.\nOn the Devices screen, in the ACCOUNTS tab, accounts are represented by top-level entries, and devices within these accounts are represented by nested entries, as seen on the example screenshot below.\nNote: Take care when blocking, deactivating or deleting accounts and devices – click on the correct checkboxes before clicking on the action button.\nWhat are groups in Portnox Cloud?\nA group in Portnox Cloud represents a group of accounts that share similar characteristics.\nYou can create groups depending on your needs and company organization. For example, you can create groups for the finance department, the marketing department, and the IT department. Alternatively, you can create groups for network administrators, system administrators, and non-administrative users.\nYou can assign users to groups manually or you can automatically connect groups in Portnox Cloud with groups in external identity management platforms such as Entra ID, Google Workplace, Okta, AD, or LDAP servers.\nYou can define basic access privileges for all members of the group. For example, you can allow the group to access specific Wi-Fi networks, wired networks, and VPNs. Detailed privileges are controlled using policies that you can assign to the group.\nYou can create a maximum of 100 groups.\nNote: When a new user/account accesses the network, it will be assigned to the first group where it matches the criteria. Groups are checked in order of the priority listed on the Groups screen. At least one group always exists: the Default group. All accounts that are not assigned to any other group are automatically assigned to this group. \nWhat are policies in Portnox Cloud?\nA policy in Portnox Cloud represents a set of settings, privileges, and requirements, which is assigned to one or more groups. You cannot assign policies directly to accounts.\nPolicies let you configure settings that Portnox Cloud applies to the group in different conditions. For example, you can create a policy that assigns the connected device to a specific VLAN. In a policy, you can also decide what to do when authentication fails, for example, quarantine the device in a special VLAN.\nYou can assign a policy to different groups but each group can only have one policy of each type. You can have multiple access control policies applied to different sites.\nPolicy types\nAccess control policies\nIn an access control policy, you decide what the NAS device should do with the user device when the user device succeeds with authentication, fails it, violates a risk policy, or is blocked by the administrator. If successful, the NAS can assign the device to a specific VLAN or ACL. In other cases, the NAS can assign the device to a quarantine VLAN or deny access to the network. \nNote: At least one access control policy always exists: the System Default Policy. All groups that are not assigned any other access control policy are automatically assigned this policy. \nEach access control policy can have maximum 25 rules.\nRisk assessment policies\nIn a risk assessment policy, you decide if Portnox Cloud should alert you or if the NAS should deny network access if the risk score of the device is too high. The risk score of the device can be calculated based on different factors such as geolocation, system settings, installed applications, operating system versions, drive encryption, and more. \nNote: Portnox Cloud can calculate the risk score only if the device has the Portnox AgentP installed or if you integrate Cloud with an endpoint management solution such as Microsoft Intune.\nNote: At least one risk assessment policy always exists: the System Default Policy. All groups that are not assigned any other risk assessment policy are automatically assigned this policy. \nYou can create a maximum of 15 risk assessment policies.\nRemediation policies\nIn a remediation policy, you decide what actions the Portnox AgentP should automatically take on user devices. For example, you can decide that AgentP should automatically update the antivirus software, turn on the firewall, remove an application, and more. \nNote: Portnox Cloud can enforce remediation policies only if the device has the Portnox AgentP installed.\nCustom RADIUS attribute policies\nIn a custom RADIUS attribute policy, you can define up to 30 custom attributes and later assign them to groups, allowing you to control which custom attributes are sent to which NAS devices when the connecting device is in a specific group. Custom RADIUS attributes are used by many NAS devices to extend the capabilities of RADIUS authentication and authorization. They let you include additional information in RADIUS messages, enabling more granular control over access and policies.\nYou can create a maximum of 25 custom RADIUS attribute policies with a maximum of 50 attributes per policy, a maximum of 20 mapping rules inside a group mapping, a maximum of 5 levels of nesting in the condition builder query, and a maximum of 30 condition rules in the condition builder query.\nTACACS+ authorization policies\nIn a TACACS+ authorization policy, you can decide what members of the group can do when accessing a TACACS+ NAS device. You can define which commands are allowed and which are forbidden, as well as control parameters of the session such as the privilege level, the timeout, and allowed services.\nWhat are sites in Portnox Cloud?\nA site in Portnox Cloud represents a physical location, such as an office, where a specific NAS device is located.\nYou can assign NAS devices to sites manually or based on the NAS device IP address.\nThe only setting that is specific to a site is the access control policy.\nNAS devices in sites can have one of the following icons:\n– Wired device\n– Wireless device\n– RADIUS/TACACS+ (terminal/shell) direct access\n– Other\nNote: Your list of sites may contain a site called Clutter. It’s a special site that contains all cases when Portnox Cloud cannot identify the NAS that is associated to the device. There can be several reasons why Portnox Cloud cannot identify the NAS, for example: the NAS may have been deleted from the system, or RADIUS packets may be using 0.0.0.0 as the NAS IP or 00-00-00-00-00-00 to represent the MAC address of the NAS."

If there is a value in the Urls row that begins with https://intunedeviceid/, note down the value after the last / symbol. \nNote: If there is no value in the Urls row or the value does not begin with https://intunedeviceid/, the device is either not managed by Intune, or the SCEP settings in Intune are incorrect. As a result, this network interface cannot be associated with an Intune-managed device, and will consume a separate license.\nIf necessary, repeat the steps above for another network interface and compare the values in the Urls field. If the values are the same, the interfaces are associated with the same device and do not consume extra licenses. \nNote: To include the Intune device ID in the certificate obtained by SCEP, follow the steps in our Intune guides, for example: Onboard Windows devices with certificates using Microsoft Intune and SCEP. If you use your own certificate authority for clients and distribute them, for example, using group policy, you must add this information to each certificate or else Portnox Cloud will have no way to associate network interfaces to devices."

  "text": "What is onboarding in Portnox Cloud?\nIn this topic, you will learn about the meaning of the term onboarding and the activities that are considered part of onboarding in Portnox™ Cloud.\nWhat is onboarding?\nIn Portnox Cloud, we use the term onboarding to refer to all the manual activities that a user must do to connect their devices to networks managed by Cloud, as well as to automatic activities and configurations pushed to devices by administrators.\nPortnox Cloud offers you several ways to authenticate with your network, and the Cloud administrator decides which ones are available to the users in the company.\nIn addition to manual onboarding by the user, the Portnox Cloud administrator can also do automatic onboarding of company devices using an endpoint management solution such as Microsoft Intune or Jamf.\nThe following are the different types of onboarding:\nOnboarding with credentials\nThe Portnox Cloud administrator can permit users to authenticate manually using credentials, which typically include a login and password. If you have integrated Cloud with an external authentication repository, Cloud communicates with that repository to verify the user’s credentials. Users with contractor accounts receive their network access password via email when the administrator creates their account in Cloud.\nIf the user is onboarding with credentials, they can configure their network connection manually or they can use the Portnox Cloud self-onboarding portal to receive and run a provisioning file. Cloud offers provisioning for iOS, Windows, and macOS (not for Android or Linux).\nNote: If you would like to onboard using credentials, please read the following topic on the security of credential-based authentication: EAP methods and their security.\nThe following are examples of onboarding manually using credentials:\nOnboard a Windows device to a Wi-Fi network with credentials\nOnboard a Windows device to a wired network with credentials\nOnboard an Android device to a Wi-Fi network with credentials\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nThe following are examples of onboarding using the self-onboarding portal and credentials:\nOnboard a Windows device to a wired network with credentials through self-onboarding\nOnboard a Windows device to a Wi-Fi network with credentials through self-onboarding\nOnboard a macOS device to a Wi-Fi network with credentials through self-onboarding\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nOnboarding with certificates\nThe Portnox Cloud administrator can require users to authenticate using a user/device certificate. To begin the manual onboarding process using a certificate, the user needs to go to the self-onboarding portal. In this portal, they receive a certificate to download, which they need to install on their device. After they install the certificate, they need to configure their operating system to connect to the network using the certificate. They can configure the operating system using the self-onboarding portal and provisioning (for supported operating systems) or manually.\nThe following are examples of onboarding using certificates:\nOnboard a Windows device to a wired network with certificates\nOnboard a Windows device to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nOnboard a macOS device to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nOnboard an iPhone to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nOnboard an Android device to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nOnboarding with AgentP\nThe simplest way to onboard users in Portnox Cloud is by using a lightweight software agent called Portnox AgentP, which is compatible with popular operating systems on computers and mobile devices. The user can download and install AgentP from the Download Portnox AgentP page or from the official application store for their mobile device. You can read more about the benefits of AgentP in the following topic: What is Portnox AgentP?.\nTo onboard with AgentP, the user runs AgentP, logs in with their credentials or through integration with an authentication repository. Then, AgentP takes care of network configuration as well as downloads and installs the necessary certificates (in operating systems other than Windows, you must configure wired networks manually).\nThe following are examples of onboarding using AgentP:\nOnboard a Windows device to a Wi-Fi or wired network with AgentP\nOnboard a macOS device to a Wi-Fi or wired network with AgentP\nOnboard an iPhone to a Wi-Fi network with AgentP\nOnboard an Android phone to a Wi-Fi network with AgentP\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nOnboarding with MAC addresses\nApart from manned devices like mobiles and computers, Portnox Cloud also allows you to connect unmanned devices such as printers, scanners, surveillance cameras, and other IoT equipment. Since these devices don’t support the 802.1X protocol, they can’t authenticate using credentials or certificates, and it’s not possible to install AgentP on them. In such cases, these devices are identified based on their MAC addresses.\nWhen connecting these devices to wired networks, you only need to physically connect them using an Ethernet cable. However, when connecting them to company Wi-Fi networks, additional setup may be required. For example, some devices might prompt you to enter a password for the company network, even if that network uses the WPA2 Enterprise protocol, which doesn’t support a common password.\nThe following are examples of onboarding using MAC addresses:\nOnboard an IoT device by creating a MAC-based account\nOnboard an IoT device by creating a MAC-based account using the registration portal\nOnboard IoT devices by creating MAC-based accounts automatically\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nAutomatic onboarding with endpoint management\nIf you use an unified endpoint management (UEM) solution such as Microsoft Intune or Jamf, you can distribute configurations and/or request certificates using the SCEP protocol for all your company devices and your users don’t need to onboard manually.\nThe following are examples of onboarding using UEM solutions:\nOnboard Windows devices with certificates using Microsoft Intune and SCEP\nOnboard Chromebooks with certificates using Google Workspace and SCEP\nOnboard macOS devices with certificates using Jamf and SCEP\nOnboard Windows devices with AgentP using Group Policy\nOnboard devices with AgentP using Microsoft Intune\nOnboard Windows devices with AgentP in unattended or kiosk mode\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side."

When an account reaches this limit, you cannot add more MAC addresses through the web portal or the REST API. To fix this, remove any unused MAC addresses to reduce the total below the 12800 limit. Alternatively, create a new MAC-based account with the same configuration as the one that has reached the limit, and add the extra MAC addresses to the new account.\nNote: By default, if a device doesn’t connect to the network for 90 days, its MAC address is removed from the MAB account. You can change this period or disable this option here: . This does not mean that the device will be removed from the Portnox Cloud account. It means that if the device has been inactive for the configured period, and it tries to authenticate again after that period using its MAC address, it will no longer be recognized. The process for the Inactive MAC-addresses purge function is as follows: \nYou add a MAC address to a MAB account – the day when you do this counts as day 1.\nThe day counter increases every day at midnight tenant-time,\nAny time the device with the MAC address authenticates, the counter resets to 1.\nThe moment that the counter reaches the configured limit, the MAC address is removed from the MAB account.\nThe device with the MAC address is no longer in the MAB account so it cannot authenticate.\nCreate a contractor account\nUse this type of account if you want to give network access to users that do not belong to the organization.\nImportant: You cannot use contractor accounts to enroll in AgentP.\nIn the Contractor email field, enter the email address of the contractor. \nPortnox Cloud will accept emails from all domains, including free domains such as gmail.com.\nOptional: In the Description field, enter the description for this account, for example, the user’s first and last name. \nOptional: Activate the Use an alias when accessing the corporate network checkbox and fill in the Alias field with a unique alias. \nSome devices do not accept the @ special character, such as for TACACS+ authorization. In such cases, you can create and use an alias instead of the email address for the login part of the credentials.\nIn the NETWORK ACCESS CREDENTIALS section, select the Password expiration option: \nNever expire: The password will never expire.\nExpire on a selected date and time: The password will expire on the selected date and time. Click on the field next to this option to select the date and time from the calendar.\nIn the GENERAL ACCOUNT SETTINGS section, click on the checkbox Allow devices without AgentP to connect using this account (\"agentless access\") to activate or deactivate it. \nIf this setting is turned on, the user represented by this account will be able to connect to the network using devices with AgentP installed as well as devices without AgentP installed.\nImportant: This setting may be overridden at the group level, when configuring the specific access layer.\nIn the Group assignment field, select the group to assign this account to. \nOptional: In the Phone field, enter a contact phone number for the user represented by this account. \nTo save your account settings, click on the Save button in the top right corner. \nPortnox Cloud will send a request to create a password to the contractor’s email address.\nThe contractor must then click on the Set account password button to set their password. \nNote: You can set password complexity for Portnox and contractor accounts by accessing: \nResult: The contractor will be able to access Portnox Cloud using their email address and the password that they set.\nCreate a device-type account\nUse this type of account if you want to give network access to a large number of similar devices that do not work with the 802.1X protocol.\nDevice-type accounts let you define rules based on device properties such as type, vendor, model, and operating system. Similar to MAC-based addresses, they are meant for devices that cannot authenticate using the 802.1X protocol, such as IoT devices.\nImportant: You can only create rules for devices that are already known to Portnox Cloud and have device properties.\nIn the Account name field, enter the name that identifies the device or group of devices represented by this account. \nOptional: In the Description field, enter the description for this account, for example, more details about the device or group of devices. \nIn the ALLOWED DEVICE TYPE section, click on the Devices must pass MAB authentication and meet the defined device properties to be assigned to this account checkbox to activate or deactivate it. \nIf this setting is turned on, only the devices that pass the MAC authentication bypass can be assigned to this account. For more information about configuring the MAC authentication bypass, see the following topic: Onboarding with MAC addresses.\nIf you activated the option in the previous step, click on the Enable IoT Device Trust checkbox to activate or deactivate it. \nIf this setting is turned on, Portnox Cloud will use MAC spoofing protection by checking if the device fingerprint matches earlier identification. If it does not match, the device may have been the victim of a MAC spoofing attack.\nNote: To use this option, you must turn on IoT device fingerprinting. You can do that here: \nIf you activate this setting, select the action to be taken:\nSend a warning alert if this account is suspected of being the victim of MAC spoofing. Devices under this account will still be allowed access to the corporate network.\nBlock devices from accessing the corporate network and send an alert if this account is the victim of MAC spoofing.\nUnder the Allow devices where heading, build the logical tree of conditions to allow device access: \nClick on the AND/OR button in a logical branch to change the logical condition.\nClick on the + button in a logical branch and select Add rule to add another condition to the current logical branch.\nClick on the + button in a logical branch and select Add And/Or block to add a sub-branch to the current logical branch.\nIn the first column of a logical rule, select Type, Vendor, Model, or OsName to set the parameter to be tested in the condition.\nIn the second column of a logical rule, select Contains, Equals, or NotEquals to set the comparison operator.\nIn the third column of a logical rule, select from the list of available values for the comparison.\nClick on the Refresh matches button to show the PREVIEW MATCHING DEVICE(S) section. \nNote: The Refresh matches button becomes active only after you select the group in the next step.\nIn the Identity Pre-Shared Key (IPSK) section, activate the Enable IPSK checkbox if your access points support IPSK and if you want to secure your Wi-Fi connections using identity pre-shared keys for this account. \nPortnox Cloud will generate an identity PSK for this account. You can view it using the 👁 icon or copy it using the ⧉ icon. You can click on the Regenerate IPSK link to regenerate it.\nIn the VoIP Assignment section, click on the Assign device to voice VLAN for successful authentication checkbox to activate or deactivate it. \nIf this setting is turned on, you can configure an access port with an attached IP phone to use one VLAN for voice traffic and another VLAN for data traffic from a device attached to the phone. Cisco Meraki switches require the following attribute pairs within the Access-Accept frame to put devices on the voice VLAN: Cisco-AVPair=\"device-traffic-class=voice\".\nIn the Group assignment field, select the group to assign this account to. \nTo save your account settings, click on the Save button in the top right corner."

You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nImportant: We strongly recommend adding the URI SAN with the https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}} value, which is the device identifier. This allows Portnox Cloud to recognize situations where one device has multiple network interfaces (a Wi-Fi interface, an Ethernet interface, etc.), so that it is treated as a single device and consumes only one license. Without this attribute, agentless devices with multiple interfaces will consume separate licenses for each interface. This attribute is also used for risk assessment policies in Portnox Cloud – it lets Portnox Cloud assess the device risk and apply suitable actions.\nIn the Key storage provider (KSP) field, select the following option: Enroll to Trusted Platform Module (TPM) KSP if present, otherwise Software KSP. \nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation.

  "text": "Integrating with SIEM platforms\nIn this section, you will learn about the options that are available in Cloud to integrate it with SIEM solution. These options may help you integrate Cloud with software that is not specifically described in our list (both cloud solutions and on-premises solutions).\nTo access the configuration for integration with SIEM solutions, click on: \nThen, click on the Add new SIEM link to create a new SIEM integration configuration.\nBelow is the explanation of the available options and their potential use.\nIntegration type: Select the type/brand of SIEM software that you want to integrate with. \nCustom: Select this option for all SIEM software other than the specific ones listed in this option.\nNamed options: Select an option for a specific SIEM type that requires a different integration. For example, select Datadog to integrate with Datadog SIEM.\nName: Enter a unique name for this integration configuration. \nStatus: Use this option only if you need to temporarily disable the integration and you do not want to delete the entire configuration. \nDisabled: If you select this option, this integration will be disabled.\nEnabled: If you select this option, this integration will be active.\nProtocol type: Select the protocol that will be used by Cloud to send events to the SIEM solution. \nThe most common method used to send events to SIEM solution is the syslog client-server architecture. This architecture describes the format of the log messages, but they can be sent to the syslog server over different protocols.\nSyslog over TCP: The messages in syslog format are sent using the TCP protocol. This requires the syslog server to be listening on an open TCP port. Note that the messages are sent in clear text and can be intercepted.\nSyslog over UDP: The messages in syslog format are sent using the UDP protocol. This requires the syslog server to be listening on an open UDP port. Note that the messages are sent in clear text and can be intercepted.\nSyslog over TLS: The messages in syslog format are sent using a TLS tunnel. This requires a TLS tunnel to be established between the client and the server. Messages are then sent encrypted and cannot be intercepted.\nHTTPS: The events are sent using an HTTPS connection. This requires an HTTPS collector listening for messages. This is a common option in cloud-based SIEM solutions such as Splunk or Sumo Logic.\nImportant: In some cases, the SIEM platform does not provide a syslog server and you may need a third-party syslog server that acts as temporary log storage. You can set up such a server, for example, in an Azure cloud or on-premises. In such cases, Cloud sends the events to the cloud syslog server, and your SIEM solution picks them up from the syslog server.\nIP: The IP address that Cloud sends events to. \nFor direct communication, this must be an external IP address that Cloud can connect to. If you need to configure the firewall to restrict this access to specific IPs, use the following IP addresses: 23.97.155.157, 52.168.164.222, 20.72.156.111, and 51.124.144.69.\nPort: The port number that Cloud sends events to. \nCommunication method: Decides how Cloud is to send events to the SIEM solution. \nDirect: Cloud will send direct messages to an external, public IP address and port as configured. You can use this method, if your cloud solution has an open port to receive messages in your cloud tenant, if your cloud solution uses a HTTPS log collector, if you have a syslog server in a public cloud such as Azure, or if you have an on-premises syslog server that listens on a public IP and port.\nVia Portnox Cloud Directory Broker: Use an on-premises Portnox LDAP Broker to collect the messages from Portnox Cloud and send them locally to your on-premises solution. In such case, the IP address and port that you specify above are the local IP address and port accessible from the machine running LDAP Broker.\nVia Docker image: portnox-siem: Use an on-premises portnox-siem Docker image to collect the messages from Portnox cloud and send them locally to your on-premises solution. In such case, the IP address and port that you specify above are the local IP address and port accessible from the machine running the Docker image.\nBy using Portnox LDAP Broker or the Docker image, you can avoid the need to have a public IP address and port to collect the logs. You can set up your syslog collector on a local machine, set up the Docker image or LDAP Broker on the same or another machine in the same local network, and then the Docker image or LDAP Broker will poll Portnox Cloud to obtain new messages and send these messages locally to your local network syslog server.\nNote: Portnox LDAP Broker requires Active Directory on-premises, and you need to integrate Cloud with Active Directory. The Docker image has no such requirements, and is therefore a better choice in most environments.\nData format: What format should the Cloud events be sent in. \nJSON: The JSON format is almost exclusively used with HTTPS collectors (see the Protocol type field).\nCEF: The CEF format (Common Event Format) is used as an extension of the syslog format to allow for sending security messages to SIEM software. If you collect data using syslog, you will most probably need to select this option.\nAlert notification interval (minutes): Specifies how often events are to be sent from Portnox Cloud to your SIEM software. \nHealth check interval (minutes): Specifies how often Portnox Cloud sends health check messages to your SIEM software, if there are no new events to send. \nUnmerge alerts: Portnox Cloud merges some alerts into a single alert for convenience. If you would rather receive every alert separately, activate this checkbox."

  "url": "https://docs.portnox.com/topics/certificates_about.html",
  "text": "Types of certificates\nIn this topic, you will learn about the different types of certificates that are used by Portnox™ Cloud to secure communications.\nBefore you begin, if you are new to the subject of digital certificates, please watch our introductory video:\nDigital certificates are used to make sure a system on the network is real and trustworthy. In Portnox Cloud, two separate certificates and certificate chains serve two purposes: \nThe root CA certificate and the RADIUS certificate: To prove to NAS devices and user devices that the Cloud RADIUS servers are authentic.\nThe tenant CA certificate and the user/device certificates: To prove to the Cloud RADIUS server that the user and/or device are authentic and can access the network securely.\nThe root CA certificate\nIn this section, we explain the function of the root CA certificate.\nRoot CA (Certificate Authority) certificates are at the top of the hierarchical structure of digital certificates used in the public key infrastructure (PKI). A Root CA is a highly trusted entity that issues digital certificates to intermediate CAs (Certificate Authorities) or directly to end entities such as the Portnox Cloud. These certificates are then used to verify the authenticity of the entities they certify.\nRoot CA certificates are pre-installed and trusted by default in web browsers, operating systems, and other applications, and any certificate issued by them is automatically trusted by those systems. However, older systems may not have all the root CA certificates, such as the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 used by Portnox Cloud. That is why Cloud provides you with this CA certificate to download and install on such systems.\nIf your system is old and it does not have the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 CA certificate installed, it will not be able to verify the identity of the Cloud RADIUS server, which will generate warnings, and in some systems it can even prevent you from using Portnox Cloud.\nYou can download the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 certificate here: , or directly from our documentation server, or directly from DigiCert.\nThe Cloud RADIUS certificate\nIn this section, we explain the function of the Cloud RADIUS certificate.\nThe Cloud RADIUS certificate is signed using the root CA certificate. Portnox purchases this certificate annually from DigiCert to guarantee the authenticity of its RADIUS servers, which use the domain name clear-rad.portnox.com.\nNote: If you verify the authenticity of the RADIUS server using the root CA certificate, then you do not need to use the RADIUS certificate. We strongly recommend that you use the root CA certificate instead of the Cloud RADIUS certificate. This is because the Cloud RADIUS certificate has a shorter validity period (1 year only), and this means you will have to reconfigure your network for the updated certificate once a year, which could also cause temporary connectivity problems for your users.\nIf you need to use the RADIUS server certificate for any purpose, contact us at success@portnox.com to receive the certificate file.\nThe SCEP server’s intermediate certificate\nIn this section, we explain the function of the SCEP server’s intermediate certificate.\nYou can use the Portnox Cloud SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) server to request certificates for your devices. The SCEP protocol works through HTTP/HTTPS requests and is mainly used by UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) and MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions.\nMost device operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and iOS, by default use SCEP via HTTP requests. However, some device operating systems such as Android require SCEP via HTTPS requests. To make such requests, the devices must have the SCEP server’s intermediate certificate to validate the SCEP server’s identity.\nThe Portnox Cloud SCEP server’s intermediate certificate is the Thawte TLS RSA CA G1 certificate. In many cases, the operating system of the device already has this standard certificate installed, and you don’t need to upload it to the device. However, it is safer to distribute the certificate using your UEM/MDM solution to make sure that every device can connect using SCEP via HTTPS.\nIf you need to use the SCEP server’s intermediate certificate to your UEM/MDM software configuration profiles, you can download it directly from our documentation server. Alternatively, you can download it from the DigiCert website.\nThe tenant CA certificate\nIn this section, we explain the function of the tenant CA certificate.\nThe tenant CA certificate is a root certificate, which means that it has no chain of signatures. It is completely independent of the root CA certificate. The tenant CA certificate is a self-signed certificate for the tenant-specific CA that is used by Portnox Cloud to authenticate your users and devices, and you should not use it for any other purpose.\nIf your organization has its own certificate authority and you want to use this CA to generate user and device certificates, you can replace the default tenant CA certificate generated by Portnox Cloud with your own CA certificate. Then, you will need to use your own CA to generate device/user certificates, and Cloud will use the uploaded tenant CA certificate to confirm if they are genuine and use them to verify users/devices.\nYou can download the tenant CA certificate or upload your own CA certificate here: .\nThe user/device certificates\nIn this section, we explain the function of the user and device certificates, also known as supplicant certificates.\nThe user/device (supplicant) certificates are signed by the tenant CA, so they have the tenant CA certificate as the root of their signature chain. This can be either the default tenant CA provided by Portnox Cloud or your own CA.\nIf you use the default tenant CA provided by Portnox Cloud, you can have Cloud generate all user and device certificates for you. This is possible because then Cloud has access to the certificate’s private key, which is needed to sign other certificates. You can, for example, ask your users to use the self-service onboarding portal to generate and download these certificates for their devices.\nIf you use your own CA that you uploaded to Portnox Cloud, then Cloud cannot generate user/device certificates because it does not have the private key. Only you have the private key because it is your certificate authority. You have to generate all user/device certificates yourself and distribute them to your users’ devices, for example, using unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions such as Intune.\nCertificate formats\nIn this section, we explain the common certificate formats used in Portnox Cloud and during onboarding.\nAll of the certificates mentioned above can be saved in various formats. In some cases, such as with endpoint management systems, you might need to convert your certificate to a different format. The three most common formats used in Portnox Cloud and onboarded devices are:\nBase-64 encoded X.509 / Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM): This is the most common format for X.509 certificates, which is a Base-64 encoded text file. To check if your certificate is in this format, you can simply open it in a text editor. If you see the BEGIN CERTIFICATE header, it means the certificate is in the PEM format. This format is sometimes called Privacy-Enhanced Mail, because it was originally developed to secure email communications.\nNote that despite the name of the format, PEM certificates are very often stored with the .crt or .cer extension, which are also used by the DER format described below, instead of the .pem extension. Some systems will even reject PEM certificates with the .pem extension. Therefore, you should not use the extension to determine the format of the file.\nX.509 DER encoded binary: This is the binary format of X.509 certificates that is also commonly used. The certificate is stored in the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format, which is part of the X.690 standard.\nNote that despite the name of the format, DER certificates are very often stored with the .cer or .crt extension, which is also used by the PEM format described below, instead of the .der extension. Some systems will even reject DER certificates with the .der extension. Therefore, you should not use the extension to determine the format of the file.\nThe rootCertificate.cer file available in Portnox Cloud for the root CA certificate is in the X.509 DER encoded binary format.\nPKCS #12: This is an archive file format for storing many cryptography objects in a single file. It is often used to combine the X.509 certificate with its corresponding private key, or to bundle all the members of the chain of trust. Many systems do not accept this format and you may need to convert the certificate to one of the two previously mentioned formats. Systems that accept the PKCS #12 format often do not accept private keys with empty passwords.\nThe most common extension for PKCS #12 files is .pfx but the extension .p12 is also used.\nThe file available in Portnox Cloud for the tenant CA certificate is in the PKCS #12 format bundled with the corresponding private key, which has an empty password.\nPKCS #7: This is a standard commonly used to bundle multiple certificates together, for example, to include a certificate and its chain of trust. This format does not store private keys.\nThe most common extension for PKCS #7 files is .p7b or .p7c.\nIn Portnox Cloud, you can use this format to import your own CA certificate as the tenant CA certificate together with any intermediate certificates if you use them to sign the supplicant certificates.\nCertificate exportability\nIn this section, we explain whether certificates generated by Portnox Cloud for users/devices can be copied to other devices.\nWhen Portnox Cloud generates a certificate for the user or device, and then AgentP or the user installs that certificate on a device, it is actually not just the certificate but a certificate-key pair: private key and the corresponding certificate (public key). Both parts are needed for authentication.\nThe certificate (public key) can always be exported. However, operating systems allow the users and applications to install the private key as exportable or non-exportable.\nIf the private key is exportable, it means that you can export it to a file.\nIf a private key is non-exportable, it means that you cannot export it to a file and, for example, copy to another device.\nThis means that if the private key is installed as non-exportable, you cannot copy it to any other device. For example, you cannot export it from the device’s operating system and upload to another device. If you export and copy just the certificate, without the private key, authentication will not work.\nAgentP certificates\nAgentP installs all private keys in non-exportable mode. That means that certificate-key pairs managed by AgentP are secure and cannot be copied by the user to another device.\nBelow is an example of the Windows certificate export screen for a certificate installed by AgentP. As you can see, the private key export option is not available.\nSelf-onboarding certificates\nCertificate-key pairs obtained through the self-onboarding portal must be installed by the user:\nYou access the self-onboarding portal, log in with your company credentials, and request a certificate to be generated.\nYour browser downloads the .p12 certificate-key pair file to your local drive.\nWhen you install this file, you add the certificate and the private key to the operating system’s certificate store.\nUnfortunately, during the installation of the certificate-key pair, the user can choose the option to install the private key as exportable:\nIf the user selects this option, the private key can later be saved to a file and copied to another device. Also, the user can copy the .p12 file to another device, and install it there. That is why AgentP is the recommended, more secure certificate management method as it prevents the user from reusing the same certificate on several devices.\nTrusted certificate server names\nIn this section, we explain why configurations optionally ask for a trusted certificate server name.\nWhen you select the certificate to verify the authenticity of the Cloud RADIUS servers, either in your operating system or in an UEM solution, you usually also have an option to trust a specific domain name. This option may be called Connect to these servers (in Windows), Certificate server names (in Intune), Trusted certificate server names (in macOS/iOS/Jamf) or Server Certificate Names (in Kandji).\nThis is an optional, extra security measure. Is not necessary, but it is recommended. It means that your operating system or your UEM software, once it verifies the validity of the certificate, checks who the certificate was issued to and compares it with the domain name that you provided. In such case, if you provide the domain name clear-rad.portnox.com, your operating system or UEM solution will confirm that the Cloud RADIUS server certificate is issued to this domain name (by checking the certificate’s Subject field), which adds an extra layer of security.\nNote: This option does not replace validating the certificate and is/should be used for extra security purposes only.\nCertificate identity information\nIn this section, we explain the importance of the identity information in the certificate, where such information is stored, and how to change the storage location.\nWhen a supplicant device presents its certificate to the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server (or other Cloud services such as Zero Trust Network Access), Portnox Cloud needs to identify the owner of the certificate. The certificate itself does not inherently contain identifying information, similar to an ID document that cannot have just a fingerprint; it must also include the owner's name for proper identification.\nCertificates have special fields that can be used to contain such information and any additional information that is required. The primary field is the Subject field, which is present in every certificate, and is usually filled with some kind of identification information. For example, for website certificates, the Subject field contains the URL of the website. However, there is an option to include more such information in certificates, and it’s called Subject Alternative Names (SAN). SAN is not just one field but rather a whole system of adding extra fields that can contain email addresses, DNS names, and much more. The most common field, used by Portnox Cloud to store the identify information is called the User Principal Name (SAN UPN).\nHowever, if you use your own tenant CA certificates instead of the ones generated by Portnox Cloud, and manage your supplicant certificates using your own CA rather than Portnox Cloud with AgentP or SCEP, you may prefer to store user identity information in a different field within the certificate. In this case, Portnox Cloud provides an option to specify where the RADIUS server should look for user identity information within the certificate: .\nIn this section, you can select more than one field that is to be checked for user identity information, and you can also drag the fields up or down to define the order in which they are to be checked.\nWarning: Do not use this setting if you are using the default Portnox Cloud tenant CA and AgentP to manage your supplicant certificates. Regardless of the option selected, when AgentP generates the certificates, the user identity information will always be stored in the SAN UPN field.\nImportant: This setting only affects where the Cloud RADIUS server checks for user identity information. For other services, such as Zero Trust Network Access, this setting does not apply, and user identity information must be stored in the SAN UPN field. For device-based certificates, such as those used for kiosks, this setting also does not apply, and device identifiers should always be stored in the SAN DNS field to be recognized by Portnox Cloud.\nNote: You can use this setting if you generate user certificates with a UEM solution and configure your SCEP profiles to store identity information in other fields, though this is not recommended. We advise configuring your user SCEP profiles to use the SAN UPN field and only adjusting this option if your UEM solution does not support the SAN UPN field.\nCertificate revocation\nIn this section, we explain what is certificate revocation and how Portnox Cloud handles certificate revocation.\nA certificate can become invalid in two ways:\nIf its expiration date passes.\nIf it is manually revoked.\nThe certificate’s expiration date is stored within the certificate itself, so it’s easy for the device’s operating system or an application to compare this date with the current date to determine if the certificate is still valid.\nHowever, if the certificate is manually revoked, this action occurs on the issuer’s side, not on the device. For example, if Portnox Cloud generates a certificate for a device and the administrator later decides to revoke it, this revocation is recorded in Portnox Cloud, not directly on the device.\nSo, how can the device’s operating system or an application such as AgentP check if the certificate is still valid?\nPortnox Cloud supports two methods for this verification:\nCRL: certificate revocation lists\nIn this method, the certificate issuer creates a list of all the certificate serial numbers that have been revoked. The operating system can download and view this list over a regular HTTP connection (it can even be opened in a browser) to see if a specific certificate is included. If the certificate is on the list, it is revoked; if it’s not on the list, it is still valid.\nThis method is simple and widely supported around the world. However, it has a drawback: if the issuer issues and cancels many certificates (such as thousands each day, like some large enterprises), the list can get very long. This may slow down the download process, making it take longer for the system to check the certificates.\nThis is an example of a CRL URL included in a Portnox Cloud certificate:\nThis is an example of a CRL list (.crl file) downloaded from Portnox Cloud and opened in Windows:\nOCSP: online certificate status protocol\nThis is a newer method, but it is not as widely supported as the CRL method. With OCSP, each certificate has a specific URL that can be queried to check if it is still valid. When a device needs to check a certificate’s status, it sends a request to this URL with the certificate’s serial number. The server then responds with the current status of that specific certificate.\nBecause the OCSP response only covers one certificate, it is much smaller and faster to process than a full CRL file, making it more efficient when many certificates are revoked.\nNote: OCSP requests and responses use a binary format, so they can only be processed by the operating system or certain applications.\nThis is an example of an OCSP URL included in a Portnox Cloud certificate:\nTo see how to configure CRL and OSCP in Portnox Cloud, see the following topic: How does Portnox Cloud handle certificate revocation?."

  "text": "EAP methods and their security\nIn this topic, you will learn more about the EAP methods used by Portnox™ Cloud, authentication repositories, and operating systems.\nThe EAP framework for the 802.1X standard allows NAS devices to communicate with RADIUS servers using different protocols. Most Portnox Cloud implementations use one of three EAP methods: EAP-TTLS-PAP, EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPv2, or EAP-TLS, but there are many more methods such as EAP-PEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-LEAP, EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, and more. In this topic, we will focus on the three EAP methods (also sometimes referred to as EAP types) that are most often used with Portnox Cloud.\nEAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security)\nThe EAP-TTLS method is based on the SSL/TLS protocol and creates a secure TLS tunnel between the user device and the RADIUS server. However, the communications inside this tunnel can use several different protocols, including some of the protocols also available directly like MSCHAPv2. While ultimately the security of this communication depends on the security of the second-level protocol (also called: inner authentication), the encrypted tunnel provides protection from most attacks.\nThe two most common second-level protocols are PAP and MSCHAPv2. PAP (Password Authentication Protocol) is a basic, clear-text authentication method, while MSCHAPv2 (Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2) is a highly secure protocol with encryption and a challenge-response mechanism. For security purposes, MSCHAPv2 is a better option than PAP.\nEAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security)\nThe EAP-TLS method is fully secure and based on digital certificates. When authenticating, the RADIUS server verifies the validity of the TLS certificate installed on the client device, and then uses information from that certificate (the Subject and possibly additional information from SAN fields) to confirm the identity of the user or the device. For example, the Subject of the certificate can contain an email address or a device ID, which are then verified with the integrated repository such as Active Directory.\nWhile EAP-TLS itself is very simple, what can be regarded as complex is the creation of individual certificates on user devices. This can be done in several ways. For example, the SCEP protocol allows the user device to contact the Portnox SCEP server, send a certificate request based on a template, and get an individual certificate. This is a method used by most unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions, which automatically deploy certificates for EAP-TLS authentication on all managed machines. Another option is to use the Microsoft Server as a CA authority and have it create and distribute user and/or device certificates using GPO.\nSupport in authentication repositories\nTo be able to use a specific protocol in 802.1X communication, each entity involved in the communication must support that protocol. This includes:\nThe operating system of the client device such as a laptop or a mobile phone.\nThe NAS device such as a network switch or a Wi-Fi access point.\nThe RADIUS server responsible for authentication, for example, Portnox Cloud servers.\nThe authentication repository provider that the RADIUS server contacts to check the user credentials.\nThe weak spot of this group is usually the authentication provider. While Microsoft Active Directory supports the secure EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPv2 protocol, most cloud providers such as Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, and Okta support PAP only. And if even one of the listed entities does not support a given protocol, you cannot use this protocol for authentication.\nThis means, for example, that if your company uses cloud-based authentication in Portnox Cloud, such as the integration with Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta, you cannot use EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPv2 with accounts in these repositories. You can only use the less secure EAP-TTLS-PAP.\nFor your convenience, here is a matrix of the most popular EAP methods and their support in authentication repositories.\nEAP method Entra ID Google Workspace Okta Workforce Identity OpenLDAP Active Directory (AD) \nEAP-TLS (certificate-based)\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t\nEAP-TTLS-PAP (credentials, TLS tunnel)\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t\nEAP-TTLS-MSCHAPv2 (credentials, encrypted, challenge-response, TLS tunnel)\t—\t—\t—\t—\tYes\t\nEAP-PEAP-MSCHAPv2 (credentials, encrypted, challenge-response, TLS tunnel)\t—\t—\t—\t—\tYes\t\nNote: Also note that Entra ID doesn’t support LDAP or secure LDAP directly. However, to achieve LDAP connectivity, you can enable an Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS) instance on your Azure AD tenant and configure network security groups through Azure Networking."

Only Tier 0 admins may manage it, it must be accessed only from PAWs, and it must follow Tier 0 network and security policies.\nTroubleshooting the installation\nIf you need help troubleshooting the installation of LDAP Broker, look for answers in the Troubleshooting section for LDAP Broker.\nMultiple LDAP Broker instances\nYou can install any number of LDAP Broker instances on any number of machines. If there is more than one LDAP Broker configured for your domain, and there is an authentication request for that domain, Portnox Cloud sends that request to all LDAP Brokers that you configured for that domain. The first LDAP Broker that responds is the one that is used for this specific request."

  "text": "Portnox Cloud best practices\nAuthentication repositories\nShould I use manual or automatic provisioning for an authentication repository?\nMost of our customers use automatic provisioning. We recommend starting with automatic provisioning. If it does not meet your requirements, you can remove it and switch to manual provisioning.\nThe choice between automatic and manual provisioning is available only for the Entra ID authentication repository. For Google Workspace, only automatic provisioning is supported, while Okta always requires manual provisioning using the REST API or LDAP.\nCan I use a hybrid configuration with Active Directory and Entra ID?\nYes, you can configure Portnox Cloud to work with both Entra ID and Active Directory. However, by default, Entra ID takes precedence. Users and devices found in Entra ID bypass synchronization with on-premises AD.\nIf you use AgentP with unattended enrollment, you can override this behavior by enabling the option to prefer on-premises AD over Entra ID.\nHow many Portnox LDAP Brokers should I use?\nWe recommend deploying at least two Portnox LDAP Brokers if you use Portnox Cloud with Active Directory or an on-premises LDAP directory. If an LDAP Broker becomes unavailable for any reason, you will lose the ability to authenticate on the network and more. The LDAP Broker is lightweight and easy to deploy.\nHow do I deploy LDAP Broker securely?\nWe strongly recommend treating LDAP Broker as a Tier 0 application because it requires high-level permissions in the local AD or LDAP directory to function. A compromise of the LDAP Broker could give an attacker full control over your local directory.\nCloud RADIUS and local RADIUS\nShould I use only Cloud RADIUS servers or local RADIUS?\nWe recommend a hybrid setup, which is used by most of our customers: deploy local RADIUS servers, configure them as the primary servers on your NAS devices, and optionally configure Cloud RADIUS servers as secondary servers. While it is possible to configure Cloud RADIUS as primary servers, this can slow response times, especially during outages, because the NAS will first attempt to contact the Cloud and only switch to the local RADIUS if the Cloud is unreachable.\nIf you configure only Cloud RADIUS servers, an Internet outage will prevent local users from logging in to the local network. We recommend this approach only if you have no local resources (i.e., all resources are cloud-based) and your local network exists solely to provide Internet access.\nHow many local RADIUS servers should I use?\nWe recommend deploying at least two local RADIUS servers. They are inexpensive to run, and having multiple servers ensures redundancy if one fails.\nThe number of local RADIUS servers depends on the capabilities of your NAS devices. Some NAS devices limit the number of RADIUS servers you can configure. If you also configure Cloud RADIUS servers, they may take available configuration slots, reducing the number available for local RADIUS servers.\nShould I run a local RADIUS server in a VM or Docker?\nWe recommend running local RADIUS servers in Docker because it is easier to set up and uses fewer machine resources.\nThe advantage of virtual machines is that the local RADIUS server is updated automatically. To enable automatic updates for a Docker-based local RADIUS server, you need to deploy the portnox-autoupdate Docker container.\nIf you prefer using virtual machines, for example, due to network or firewall configurations, the local RADIUS server can run on all major virtual machine platforms.\nDoes it make sense to run a local RADIUS server in a cloud service?\nWhile it is possible to configure a local RADIUS server in a cloud service (and we provide instructions on how to do this on Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud), we recommend running the local RADIUS server on-premises only, as most of our customers do. Its primary purpose is to provide connectivity during Internet outages, and placing it in a cloud service would make it inaccessible during such outages.\nIf your goal is to enhance security by running a local RADIUS server in the cloud, this is unnecessary. The local RADIUS server connects to Portnox Cloud using fully secure TLS communications, and you can also configure Cloud RADIUS with RadSec to ensure fully encrypted RADIUS communication.\nShould I use RadSec if it is available on my NAS device, or is RADIUS secure enough?\nMost of our customers use RADIUS without RadSec. The RADIUS protocol supports different authentication methods. The methods we recommend (see below), such as EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS, are fully secure even without RadSec because they never transmit credentials in plain text.\nIf you must use credential-based authentication with a less secure method such as PEAP, for example, if your authentication repository does not support stronger methods and you prefer not to use certificates, we recommend configuring RadSec to prevent credential leakage through man-in-the-middle attacks.\nRegardless of the EAP methods used, if your devices support RadSec, the only drawback is increased configuration complexity. This is especially true for RadSec mutual authentication, which requires uploading the device’s root certificate to Portnox Cloud.\nAuthentication methods\nShould I use certificates, credentials, or MAC-based authentication?\nWe strongly recommend using certificates for authentication (the EAP-TLS method for RADIUS/802.1X). Certificates are supported on all major platforms, provide a much higher level of security than credentials, and are compatible with all authentication repositories.\nIf you must use credentials, be aware that many authentication repositories do not support highly secure credential exchange. For example, Google Workspace requires users to create individual app passwords for credential-based authentication, which makes onboarding time-consuming and complex. Entra ID only supports EAP-TTLS, which is less secure than PEAP-MSCHAPv2 supported by on-premises directories such as Active Directory. Therefore, credentials should be used only when absolutely necessary, and preferably only with on-premises authentication repositories.\nMAC-based authentication should be treated as a last resort, only for devices that do not support other methods, such as some IoT devices. It is not fully secure because MAC addresses can be spoofed. While Portnox Cloud provides MAC spoofing detection, MAC-based authentication remains less secure than using certificates or credentials.\nShould I use user certificates or device certificates?\nYour choice depends on how your devices are used. For mostly individual devices or devices that support user accounts and are shared among multiple users, we recommend using user-based certificates for authentication.\nFor devices that do not support user accounts, such as kiosks, scanners, and similar devices, device-based certificates are preferable, as you cannot identify the individual using the device.\nDevice authentication is available only with Entra ID, Active Directory, or on-premises LDAP directories. Google Workspace and Okta do not support device accounts. If you want to use device-based authentication with Google Workspace or Okta, Portnox Cloud must create local Portnox accounts for the devices, requiring you to manage these devices directly in Portnox Cloud instead of your usual authentication repository.\nShould I use Portnox certificates or my own certificate authority?\nWe strongly recommend using the certificate authority provided by Portnox Cloud for ease of configuration. While Portnox Cloud allows you to upload your own CA certificate and issue certificates to users and devices, this places the entire certificate management process on you. Portnox Cloud cannot directly use your CA; it can only verify whether the certificates presented by devices are valid. You are then responsible for managing all device configuration processes and certificate issuance, including providing your own SCEP server or alternative methods to distribute certificates to all devices.\nAgent-based and agentless onboarding\nShould I use AgentP or can I authenticate and configure my devices without it?\nMost customers use AgentP because it simplifies device configuration and provides additional benefits, such as risk assessment. We highly recommend using AgentP.\nIf you already use a Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform, such as Intune, Jamf, or others, you can obtain certificates from Portnox Cloud via the SCEP protocol and deliver them to devices, as well as configure device interfaces to use these certificates. However, this process is more complex than using AgentP, and while many UEM platforms have been tested, not all fully support SCEP.\nIf you want to use risk assessment without AgentP, you must use Intune or Jamf. These are the supported platforms for providing risk assessment information to Portnox Cloud. You can also assess risk using other supported platforms, such as SentinelOne, which works together with Intune to deliver risk information to Portnox Cloud, enabling you to decide whether to limit network access when risk levels are high.\nShould I use single-user, multi-user, or device onboarding with AgentP?\nIf the device supports multiple users, for example, a Windows desktop used by several employees, such as a reception computer, use multi-user onboarding with AgentP. This allows Portnox Cloud to assign different certificates and access rights for each user (user authentication) and separate certificates and access rights when no user is logged on (computer authentication). Note that this requires Windows integrated with Entra ID or Active Directory.\nIf the device is a personal device used by a single user, such as a personal laptop, use single-user authentication. The device will always retain the access rights of that user.\nIf the device is not tied to any users, such as a self-service kiosk, use device-based authentication because the actual user cannot be identified.\nShould I distribute AgentP to all the machines in my networks?\nWe recommend distributing AgentP using your existing UEM/MDM software, such as Intune or Jamf, just as you use these platforms to manage other applications on users' devices. If you use Windows with Entra ID or Active Directory, the user onboarding process is fully automated because AgentP can retrieve user information directly from the operating system integrated with the same authentication repository. For other repositories and operating systems, users must manually log in to the authentication repository to start using AgentP.\nIf automatic distribution is not possible, or if users have BYOD devices, they can download AgentP directly from the web or app stores, install it easily, and log in to the authentication repository to get AgentP fully operational in under a minute.\nNetwork device configuration\nShould I configure NAS devices in any special way to work best with Portnox Cloud?\nWe strongly recommend checking whether your device supports a feature often called critical authentication or critical VLAN, and configuring it if available. Refer to your device manual to determine support and setup instructions. This feature allows users to connect to the local network even during a RADIUS failure, such as an Internet outage (if no local RADIUS is configured) or a local RADIUS outage (especially if only one local RADIUS is used). Essentially, if the device cannot reach any configured RADIUS servers, it will still allow user connections to the local network but assign them to a special VLAN with limited privileges.\nWe strongly recommend using the Portnox Cloud monitoring mode when testing new NAS device configurations. Monitoring mode does not lock anyone out of the network, but lets you observe connections to ensure correct setup. After monitoring user behavior for a short period, you can disable monitoring mode.\nPortnox groups and policies\nWhat is the best way to set up Portnox groups?\nWe strongly recommend keeping the Default group as a catch-all or radar group. Configure this group with minimal access rights (for example, only Internet access and no local resources) and allow any authenticated devices or users to initially connect here. Periodically review who ends up in this group and assign them to higher-access groups as needed. Especially during testing or early onboarding, this approach simplifies deployment and accelerates onboarding.\nCreate only the minimum number of groups required with different privileges. While having more groups does not negatively affect Portnox Cloud performance, it increases management complexity, making mistakes and troubleshooting more likely.\nWhat is the best way to set up Portnox policies and sites?\nWe strongly recommend keeping the number of policies to a minimum. Although many policies do not impact Portnox Cloud performance, they increase management complexity and the risk of human error.\nUse sites only when necessary, primarily for site-level identification in alerts or troubleshooting. Adding sites increases management complexity and the likelihood of mistakes.\nMigration\nWhat is the best way to migrate from the current network setup to a setup based on Portnox Cloud?\nWhen migrating Wi-Fi connections, we strongly recommend creating a parallel SSID: \nKeep the legacy SSID active while introducing a new 802.1X-secured SSID.\nPush new SSID profiles to managed devices via AgentP, UEM/MDM software, or GPO.\nThis approach provides a safe runway for testing before retiring the old SSID. \nIf absolutely necessary, you can reuse the existing SSID while changing its authentication method to Portnox RADIUS. This requires all devices to be pre-provisioned with certificates and proper configurations, for example, using AgentP, UEM/MDM software, or GPO. Note that this approach carries a higher risk of service disruption. We strongly recommend keeping a fallback SSID available during cutover.\nWhat is the best-practices migration process?\nPlanning\nInventory current SSIDs, VLANs, ACLs, DHCP scopes, etc.\nDocument any existing authentication methods and segmentation policies.\nDefine migration goals (e.g., move to certificate-based authentication).\nLab testing and pilot roll-out\nCreate a test SSID using the Cloud RADIUS.\nValidate authentication and connectivity across required device types (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, IoT).\nConfirm correct VLAN assignment and fallback behavior during RADIUS downtime.\nEnsure that the monitoring mode is enabled on NAS devices to log issues without blocking access.\nStart with IT staff or early adopters.\nUse the Devices page and Alerts in Portnox Cloud to monitor authentication results.\nStaged deployment\nOnce comfortable with the testing, expand the migration department-by-department or site-by-site.\nEnsure all managed devices have AgentP installed or the necessary SCEP profiles pushed from UEM/MDM software before cutting over.\nIf the devices aren’t using certificates, ensure the necessary MAC addresses are whitelisted in Portnox.\nValidation\nConfirm RADIUS responses and redundancy.\nValidate certificate delivery workflows (AgentP, SCEP, UEM/MDM).\nCheck that the correct VLANs and policies are applied per group.\nLegacy SSID retirement\nDisable old SSIDs only after confirming full coverage.\nEnsure fallback/quarantine VLAN exists for stragglers, if necessary.\nPost-migration cleanup\nTurn off the monitoring mode for all NAS devices gradually.\nRemove obsolete SSIDs and unused configurations.\nAudit NAS devices for consistency.\nUpdate any internal documentation to reflect the new SSID structure and Portnox policies."

For example, if you assigned 60 to this attribute, the value of the attribute for further risk calculation is 20.\nAfter all attributes are calculated, Cloud finds the maximum value of all the attributes and that maximum is the final value for this risk assessment policy.\nFor example: If there are two attributes, one of value 40 and one of value 60, and both are found to be in violation, the final risk score is 60.\nAdditionally, the risk score calculated earlier for the same device influences the currently calculated risk score for the device according to the following formula: new_score = 0.95 * calculated_score + 0.05 * old_score"

  "text": "How does Portnox Cloud handle certificate revocation?\nNote: For more information about OCSP and CRL, see the following topic: Certificate revocation.\nThere are two options in Portnox Cloud for publishing revocation information for certificates:\nIf you use the Portnox root certificate and public key (default setting) to generate user/device certificates, you can include OCSP (online certificate status protocol) information with the certificate. This information is included in the Certificate Authority Information Access extension.\nTo include OCSP information with Portnox Cloud certificates, go to the section, click on the Edit link, activate the Include OCSP info checkbox, and then click on the Save button.\nIf you use the Portnox root certificate and public key (default setting) to generate user/device certificates, you can use your tenant’s CRL (certificate revocation list) hosted by Portnox.\nTo include CRL information with Portnox Cloud certificates, go to the section, click on the Edit link, activate the Include CRL info checkbox, and then click on the Save button.\nThe URL of your CRL is displayed in the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) URL field.\nIf you use your own certificate authority to generate certificates, and you publish a CRL (certificate revocation list) on your own web server, you can include the URL of that CRL when adding your own certificate.\nFollow the procedure described in the following topic: Onboard devices using your own root certificate authority. After uploading your own certificate, click on the Edit link, activate the checkbox in the CHECK REVOCATION column, and enter your CRL URL in the CUSTOM CRL URL column. Then, click on the Save link.\nTo revoke a certificate generated by Portnox Cloud, go to the Devices pane, select an account, and scroll down the right-hand side pane. If the account has a certificate that can be revoked, there is a Revoke certificate button.\nNote: The effect is not immediate. The certificate revocation lists hosted by Portnox Cloud are updated every 90 minutes.\nSCEP certificate revocation\nRevocation, invalidation, or removal of SCEP certificates is fully handled by the endpoint management software that requested the certificate from Portnox Cloud in the first place.\nThe SCEP protocol does not specify a method to request certificate revocation. Therefore, to invalidate certificates requested originally through SCEP, the endpoint management software must remove certificates that are installed on devices. For example, the Intune documentation states that SCEP certificates are removed but not revoked when using a third-party certification authority (such as Portnox Cloud)."

  "text": "How does Portnox handle ZTNA certificate expiration and renewal for SSO-enabled web applications?\nZTNA uses digital certificates to create a trusted connection with SSO‑enabled web applications. These certificates are valid for 3 years and must be renewed before they expire. If a certificate expires, all users will lose ZTNA-based access to the application until a valid certificate is available.\nNote: Cloud does not currently send notifications about upcoming certificate expiration, so administrators need to plan ahead and manage renewals manually. We recommend creating reminders before certificate expiry time. We are also working on adding a function in Cloud to notify administrators about upcoming certificate expiry.\nTo manually replace the certificate during a maintenance window:\nIf the application allows you to upload more than one certificate: \nGenerate a new certificate in Cloud before the current certificate expires.\nUpload the new certificate to the application.\nKeep the new certificate inactive until you are ready to switch.\nWhen the old certificate expires (or during a maintenance window), activate the new certificate in Cloud.\nActivate the new certificate in the application.\nOptionally, after confirming that the integration is working, delete the old certificate from Cloud and the application to avoid confusion.\nNote: Cloud allows up to two certificates in the application integration at the same time. If two are already present, remove an expired or inactive certificate before adding a new one.\nIf the application allows you to upload only one certificate: \nGenerate a new certificate in Cloud.\nDuring a maintenance window, upload the new certificate to the application, replacing the existing one.\nActivate the new certificate in Cloud.\nOptionally, after confirming that the integration is working, delete the old certificate from Cloud to avoid confusion.\nWe recommend creating and maintaining internal documentation that describes the exact steps required to update certificates for each application you use with Cloud. Having these steps written down in advance will make the replacement process faster, clearer, and less likely to cause errors when a certificate needs to be renewed."

  "url": "https://docs.portnox.com/topics/faq_device_types.html",
  "text": "How does Portnox Cloud know the device make/model?\nWhen a device connects to Portnox Cloud using AgentP, AgentP sends system information to Portnox Cloud, which includes the device name and type (if found in the device’s system information). Therefore, when viewing the device in the device grid, AgentP devices have the most information available, and this information persists even if AgentP was uninstalled. Similar information may also be provided through LDAP fields for the device in case of LDAP-based onboarding.\nAdditionally, when any device connects to the network protected by Portnox Cloud, Cloud attempts to automatically recognize the device make/model on the basis of two mechanisms:\nMAC addresses: The first three bytes of the MAC address are called the vendor address component and they uniquely identify the vendor of the equipment. The last three bytes are used by every vendor differently. Portnox uses its own proprietary method of examining MAC addresses that is called MAC address clustering, which not only gives information about the vendor but also lets Portnox identify the make and model of the device.\nNote: Many devices allow you to spoof the MAC address, for example, you can easily change the MAC address of any network adapter on a Windows computer. The spoofed address may specify another vendor and another device type. Therefore, MAC address information is not fully reliable.\nDHCP fingerprinting: Portnox Cloud uses DHCP fingerprinting to prevent MAC spoofing and to gather more reliable information about the device. DHCP requests do not include information about the vendor, device type, or model, but their structure is unique and different for most devices.\nPortnox Cloud uses specialist DHCP fingerprinting databases in partnership with other security providers. This lets Portnox Cloud submit the unique DHCP fingerprint and get information about most probable device make/model from those databases.\nDHCP fingerprints cannot be spoofed like MAC addresses, and therefore if a DHCP fingerprint is found in a database as an exact match, the information about the device make/model is reliable. However, there are rare cases when less common devices may not be recognized in DHCP fingerprint databases, or where DHCP fingerprints of two devices are identical.\nPortnox Cloud uses both the MAC address information and the DHCP fingerprinting information to specify the device make/model. It is thanks to using both of them at the same time, that this information can be as precise as possible.\nHowever, there are cases when none of the above information is available: there is no AgentP or LDAP onboarding to provide the information, and neither the MAC address nor the DHCP databases provide specific information about the device’s make, model, or type. In such situations, it is displayed in the device grid using its MAC address, and any other information is described as unknown.\nNote: The device type can change during the first connection of the device. This is because before the device fully connects to the network, the only piece of information available for fingerprinting is the MAC address. After the device connects to the NAS, Portnox Cloud can perform full fingerprinting."

For example, you can allow only your developers to access your development applications, and only your finance department to access your finance applications. If you choose to control this access at the application-level, you can create one group for all users.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one group called Default, which contains all your users that are not specifically assigned to any other groups.\nConfigure risk assessment policies and assign them to groups. \nRisk assessment policies help you check if a user’s device is secure enough to access applications. You can give different importance to various conditions, like not having antivirus software or using an old version of the operating system. If the total score exceeds a certain limit, you can consider the device as unsafe.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one risk assessment policy called System Default Policy, which is set up with recommended security measures for all operating systems, and which is assigned to the Default group.\nConfigure access control policies for applications and assign them to groups. \nAn access control policy for an application decides what to do if the risk assessment policy labels the device as unsafe. You can choose to let unsafe devices use your applications, or you can tell the user what they should do to make their device safe.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one access control policy called System Default Policy, which is set up to deny access to unsafe devices, and which is assigned to the Default group."

Access to the network can be granted based on user/device identity and/or risk profile.\nPortnox Cloud is easy to set up and can be configured in even only a few minutes for the first devices.\nHow does Portnox Cloud work?\nIn a standard network, devices usually connect to the company network using one of the following methods:\nFor a wired device, you simply connect the Ethernet cable to the switch.\nFor a wireless device, you select the network (SSID) and enter a password common for all devices.\nThis is not a secure approach. It may let an intruder access your network easily, using any Ethernet cable or by obtaining a password that many other people use. Instead, you can use Portnox Cloud for a zero-trust approach:\nWhen you connect the Ethernet cable to the secured network switch, your device has no access to the network at all. When you try to connect your device to the secured Wi-Fi using a common password, it refuses the connection.\nTo connect to the network, you must authenticate. To do that, you either enter your corporate email and a password, connect to your company identity service (for example, Entra ID or Google Workspace), or use a secure user/device certificate generated for your device.\nThe network switch or Wi-Fi access point contacts the Cloud RADIUS server automatically, checks the user credentials based on your company directory, and receives a reply that says if it should allow your device to access the network or not. Additionally, the Cloud RADIUS server indicates the network to connect to, for example, a department network, an Internet-access-only network, or a quarantine network.\nNote that devices such as IoT, which are unmanned, can simply be recognized by their MAC addresses instead. Portnox Cloud also works with VPN networks. You can also create guest accounts and control guest user access.\nHow does Portnox Cloud monitor risk?\nWith the addition of Portnox AgentP, Portnox Cloud can do even more: monitor the risk of your device and manage network access on the basis of that risk. It can even remediate certain risk conditions.\nYou can create risk profiles for different devices. For example, you can decide that a mobile phone that has an outdated operating system and applications from unknown sources is too risky to connect to your network. Or you can decide that a laptop with no disk encryption needs to be connected to a limited network with Internet access only and no access to company resources.\nYou can configure Portnox AgentP, for example, to discover that your device has an outdated antivirus or operating system, and automatically start an update. You can also configure it to automatically uninstall a suspicious application. This way, AgentP can remediate the device to lower its risk profile, and then let it access the network without your intervention.\nPortnox Cloud architecture"

  "text": "Secure networks\nIn this topic, you will learn about the shortfalls of traditional networking and solutions that improve your network security to avoid being hacked.\nNetwork security risks in typical Ethernet and Wi-Fi setups\nIn this section, you will explore the common security risks associated with typical Ethernet and Wi-Fi setups. We’ll examine why these standard networks are often vulnerable to attacks and what makes them easy targets for malicious hackers.\nTypical Ethernet and pre-shared key Wi-Fi networks are easy to breach, allowing attackers to quickly escalate their access and reach critical systems. Once inside the network, attackers can use a variety of techniques to gain further access. Networks should be the first line of defense against hackers, but common network setups often fail to stop them.\nEthernet: Anyone who gains physical access to the premises, such as a contractor or technician, can plug into a network switch with an Ethernet cable and gain direct network access. Default network switch configurations do not prevent this.\nPre-shared key Wi-Fi: When an employee leaves, they still know the Wi-Fi password, and changing it for everyone each time someone leaves is often seen as too difficult or inconvenient. Additionally, current employees can easily share the password with others, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.\nThe only widely accepted industry standard that provides strong authentication and authorization for each Ethernet port and every Wi-Fi user is 802.1X. Other methods exist but are far less secure and effective compared to 802.1X.\n802.1X: The standard for secure network access\nIn this section, you will learn what 802.1X is and what it enables for network access control. The section explains its role in securing Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, its use with RADIUS for authentication, and how it forms the basis of WPA-Enterprise in wireless environments.\n802.1X (usually pronounced dot-one-ex) is a network access control standard developed by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), originally published in 2001 and most recently updated in IEEE Std 802.1X-2020. It defines a framework for authenticating users and devices using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), supporting a range of methods like passwords, certificates, and smart cards across both wired and wireless networks.\nEthernet: 802.1X allows network switches to require authentication before granting access to a device plugged into a port. Most managed switches support 802.1X and can be configured to block network access on a port until a valid user or device is authenticated using EAP through a RADIUS server. This prevents unauthorized devices from gaining access just by connecting a cable.\nWi-Fi: 802.1X is the foundation of WPA-Enterprise, which is supported by most business-grade access points and wireless controllers. Instead of using a shared Wi-Fi password, each user authenticates individually through EAP and a RADIUS server. This enables per-user access control and makes it much harder for unauthorized users to connect.\nIn both Ethernet and Wi-Fi setups, 802.1X relies on a RADIUS server to handle the authentication process, verifying the user’s or device’s credentials and informing the switch or access point whether to allow or deny network access. RADIUS is a protocol used to communicate authentication and authorization requests between network devices and an authentication server. In an 802.1X setup, the network device sends user credentials to a RADIUS server using this protocol, and the server verifies the information before granting or denying access.\nCloud-based 802.1X: The future of network access control\nIn this section, we explain why cloud-based 802.1X solutions offer a more cost-effective and flexible alternative to traditional on-premises hardware setups.\nCloud-based 802.1X removes the dependency on expensive, specialized hardware and lowers the complexity of managing network access control. It offers greater flexibility, easier scalability, and faster deployment compared to traditional on-premises solutions tied to physical equipment.\nTraditional 802.1X solutions require buying and maintaining physical hardware, which adds upfront and ongoing costs. Cloud-based solutions handle authentication remotely, removing the need for on-site devices.\nOn-premises setups often need local access for configuration and troubleshooting. Cloud management allows IT teams to control authentication from anywhere through a simple web interface.\nAdding users or locations to traditional systems means buying more hardware and complex setup. Cloud-based 802.1X scales easily by adjusting resources without physical installation.\nUpdating on-premises equipment requires manual work and scheduled downtime. Cloud services deliver updates automatically, ensuring continuous security improvements.\nIntegrating traditional solutions with modern identity and security systems often requires additional tools and complex setups. Cloud-based 802.1X connects directly to cloud identity platforms as well as works together with UEM, and SIEM solutions, making integration simpler and more efficient.\nHardware failures and maintenance cause network downtime in on-premises systems. Cloud providers use redundant infrastructure to reduce disruptions and improve availability.\nIn a cloud-based 802.1X setup, network devices like switches and access points communicate authentication requests from users or devices to a cloud-hosted RADIUS server. When a device tries to connect, the network equipment forwards its credentials securely to the cloud service, which verifies the information against centralized authentication repositories. Once the user or device is authenticated, the cloud server signals the network device to grant or deny access. This approach removes the need for on-premises authentication hardware and allows for centralized, remote management of network access policies.\nA common concern with cloud-based network access control is what happens during an Internet outage, specifically whether users will lose network access if Portnox Cloud becomes temporarily unreachable. In such cases, active sessions are not interrupted and connected users remain online. However, new authentication requests cannot be processed by the cloud during the outage. To address this, Portnox Cloud supports a local cache component that runs on-premises as a virtual machine or Docker container. This local fallback allows previously authenticated users to reauthenticate and maintain access based on cached credentials and policies. New users or devices that have not connected before will be denied access until connectivity to the cloud is restored.\nSecure access for devices that can’t use 802.1X\nIn this section, you will learn how devices that do not support 802.1X can still be securely connected to the network using MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), and how Portnox helps manage and control access for these devices.\nWhile nearly all modern computers, mobile devices, and operating systems support 802.1X for secure network authentication, many office devices do not. These include printers, IP phones, badge readers, video conferencing systems, and even some IoT devices. Despite their lack of 802.1X support, these devices still need to connect to the network securely. Simply leaving Ethernet ports open for such devices poses a serious security risk – anyone could unplug the device and connect an unauthorized laptop. Likewise, creating a shared Wi-Fi SSID with a common password introduces more risks and undermines the purpose of secure network access.\nThis is where MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) comes in. MAB is a fallback authentication method used when a device does not support 802.1X. Instead of using user or certificate-based authentication, MAB identifies a device based on its MAC (Media Access Control) address – a unique hardware identifier assigned to the device’s network interface.\nWhat happens when a non-802.1X device connects to the network?\nThe device connects to a switch port or wireless access point, but does not initiate 802.1X authentication.\nThe switch or access point detects the lack of 802.1X response and triggers MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).\nThe network device sends the MAC address of the connected device to Portnox Cloud, requesting authentication.\nPortnox checks the MAC address against its known devices list and applies the appropriate access control policy.\nIf the MAC address is recognized and allowed, the device is granted access with the defined permissions (e.g., VLAN assignment or limited access). If the MAC is unknown or blacklisted, access is denied or restricted to a remediation network.\nWhile MAB enables access for non-802.1X devices, it is inherently less secure because MAC addresses can be easily spoofed. Many devices – including most laptop network adapters – allow users to manually set the MAC address, and modern smartphones like iPhones often use randomized MAC addresses to enhance privacy. This poses a challenge for relying on MAC addresses for authentication. For example, an attacker could identify the MAC address of a legitimate device, disconnect it, and then connect their own laptop using the same MAC address.\nTo prevent this type of spoofing, Portnox Cloud uses an advanced IoT fingerprinting mechanism. This works by analyzing the DHCP traffic a device generates upon connection – traffic patterns that are highly specific to each device type and operating system. If another device later connects using the same MAC address but presents a different DHCP fingerprint, Portnox Cloud immediately identifies the mismatch, issues a warning, and blocks the connection, helping to maintain the integrity of network access.\nCentralized management for 802.1X authentication\nIn this section, you will learn how cloud-based 802.1X can integrate with your current user databases and authentication systems.\nCloud-based 802.1X works with your existing user databases and authentication systems, so there is no need to create or manage separate credentials. This simplifies administration and enhances security by keeping user management centralized in one place.\nReusing existing user repositories like Active Directory, Google Workspace, Okta Workforce Identity, or Entra ID reduces the need to create and maintain multiple accounts, lowering the chance of errors and inconsistencies.\nCentralized authentication simplifies management by applying consistent access policies across all systems, reducing administrative overhead and improving compliance.\nCloud-based 802.1X supports standard protocols to integrate smoothly with common directory services such as LDAP and modern identity providers, enabling flexible deployment.\nManaging users from a single authentication source improves security by reducing potential attack points.\nUsing familiar authentication platforms speeds up user onboarding and offboarding, ensuring access rights are updated quickly and accurately without extra manual steps.\nWhile these integrations provide significant benefits, Portnox Cloud also offers its own internal authentication repository, which can be used alongside existing systems, for example, to manage contractors, or independently without relying on any external directory.\nProviding secure access for guests and temporary users\nIn this section, you will learn how to securely provide limited network access to guests, contractors, and other temporary users who are not included in your organization’s authentication repository, using captive portals and other access controls.\nSome users – such as contractors, auditors, temporary workers, visitors, or vendors – are not added to the organization’s main authentication repository but still require Internet or limited network access while on-site. These users need a simplified access method without full onboarding.\nPortnox Cloud offers guest access primarily through captive portals, which are functions provided by network access devices (NAS) such as wireless access points, routers, or wireless controllers. Captive portals are used exclusively for Wi-Fi access and do not apply to wired Ethernet connections. The captive portal serves as the authentication gateway for guests, supporting various authentication methods including sponsored guest approval by internal users, SMS confirmation codes sent to the guest’s mobile device, or simple acceptance of terms via a disclaimer.\nTo enable captive portal functionality, compatible network equipment is required, as Portnox Cloud relies on these devices to enforce captive portal authentication and control network access. Compared to basic captive portals configured solely on network devices, integrating captive portals with Portnox Cloud provides extra benefits:\nProvides a single, unified portal management interface for guest policies and user accounts, even though captive portals still run on individual network devices\nEnables advanced guest authentication options like sponsored guest approvals and SMS confirmation codes, which standalone portals may not support\nCentralizes guest access logging and reporting for compliance, consolidating data from multiple devices into one system\nSimplifies onboarding and lifecycle management of guest users without configuring each device separately beyond enabling the captive portal function\nSupports seamless integration with Portnox Cloud’s broader access management ecosystem through a single portal\nContractor accounts offer a solution for users who need broader access than typical guests. These accounts are created directly in Portnox Cloud without adding users to the main authentication repository and use external email addresses. Unlike captive portal guests, contractor accounts support both Wi-Fi and Ethernet access. Since they function like regular user accounts, administrators can assign them to groups, allowing controlled and flexible access to internal resources.\nSecuring administrative access to network devices\nThis section explains how TACACS+ can be used with Portnox Cloud to control administrative access to network infrastructure devices such as switches, firewalls, and routers.\nTACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus) is a protocol commonly used to manage and authenticate administrative access to network devices. It separates authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA), making it a preferred choice for network device management where fine-grained control is needed over who can run which commands.\nPortnox Cloud includes support for TACACS+ via an on-prem component running in a virtual machine or a Docker container. It provides centralized management of admin logins for compatible NAS devices such as enterprise switches, firewalls, and wireless controllers. This allows administrators to define who can access specific devices, what commands they can execute, and to maintain full audit logs of access activity – all managed through the same Portnox Cloud interface used for user and device access control.\nBenefits of TACACS+ with Portnox Cloud:\nLocal TACACS+ proxy with cloud policy control – While a lightweight on-premises component is required, all policy logic and user validation happens in the cloud, reducing local configuration complexity.\nCentralized management of admin access policies – All TACACS+ access rules are defined and managed in the Portnox Cloud UI, ensuring consistent enforcement across all supported network devices.\nUnified identity source – Reuse the same identity providers (e.g., AD, LDAP) configured in Portnox Cloud for user authentication, without managing a separate local database.\nRole-based command control – Define what administrative commands or privilege levels are available per user or group across different network device types.\nConsolidated auditing – Admin login attempts and executed commands are logged centrally, enabling comprehensive audit trails for compliance and security reviews.\nUsing Portnox Cloud for TACACS+ removes the need to run and maintain an on-prem TACACS+ server while still allowing advanced AAA policy control for infrastructure devices. This setup is useful in medium to large environments where managing admin access on a per-device basis becomes operationally complex and less secure.\nMeeting regulatory standards with cloud-based 802.1X\nIn this section, you will learn how cloud-based 802.1X helps organizations meet key regulatory and security standards.\nStandards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO/IEC 27001 require organizations to control and monitor access to their networks. Cloud-based 802.1X enforces user and device authentication before network access, fulfilling access control requirements. Its centralized logging and reporting provide the audit trails needed to prove compliance. Continuous monitoring supports risk management and timely incident response, which are key parts of these standards.\nPCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Helps meet Requirement 8 (Identify and authenticate access to system components) by enforcing strong user and device authentication before network access. Also supports Requirement 10 (Track and monitor all access to network resources) through centralized logging of authentication events.\nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Addresses the Security Rule’s Access Control Standard by restricting network access to authorized users and devices. Provides audit controls for access monitoring and helps with the Integrity Standard by preventing unauthorized access to protected health information.\nGDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): Supports Article 32 (Security of processing) by implementing appropriate access controls to protect personal data. Provides audit logs that help demonstrate accountability and compliance with data protection principles.\nISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management): Aligns with Annex A.9 (Access Control) by enforcing user authentication and authorization on network devices. Supports Annex A.12.4 (Logging and Monitoring) with detailed records of access attempts and changes, enabling audit readiness.\nCloud-based 802.1X provides easier management and clearer audit information, helping organizations meet such regulatory requirements without the complexity of traditional hardware-based solutions."

  "text": "Secure resources\nIn this topic, you will learn how Portnox ZTNA uses certificates – the same ones used for network access – to provide secure and controlled access to third-party applications and services (referred to as resources). This includes SSO-enabled web applications as well as on-premises resources like local web applications, allowing both local and remote users to safely connect to cloud resources and securely access on-premises and private cloud environments.\nSecurity risks in accessing cloud and on-premises resources\nIn this section, you will learn about the security shortcomings and challenges of common methods for accessing applications and resources: how SSO still relies on passwords and MFA with their inherent weaknesses, and how private resources are often accessed through VPNs that grant broad network access rather than limiting access to specific resources, while also being costly and complex to manage.\nOrganizations typically access their resources in two main ways: cloud-based web applications via traditional SSO platforms like Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta Workforce Identity, and on-premises or private cloud resources usually accessed through VPNs. Both approaches have significant security and usability limitations.\nIn the case of SSO-enabled web applications:\nThey are typically accessed using traditional SSO combined with MFA. These methods share the same vulnerabilities as passwords and MFA (see: Passwordless authentication).\nIf the SSO access is compromised, an attacker can gain access to all connected applications. Although major providers like Microsoft, Google, and Okta invest heavily in security, the fundamental weaknesses of passwords and MFA remain.\nSSO verifies the user’s identity but does not check the security or condition of the device being used. This means access could come from an insecure or compromised machine, such as one infected with a rootkit that can capture credentials and MFA tokens.\nIn the case of private resources hosted on-premises or in private clouds:\nThe most common method for accessing on-premises and private cloud resources is through VPNs, which tend to be expensive and complex to configure and maintain.\nVPNs create a network tunnel between the user’s device and the entire internal network, granting broad access to all applications and services without granular control. This means a potential attacker could explore and exploit multiple resources once inside.\nSimilar to SSO access, VPNs grant network access without verifying the security status of the user’s device, potentially allowing compromised devices with malware to gain unrestricted entry into the local network.\nEven if your network is secured with 802.1X and certificates, users often access resources from outside these protected environments, which significantly increases the risk of compromise through the weaknesses described above.\nSecure access to SSO-enabled web applications\nIn this section, you will learn how certificate-based authentication addresses the limitations of traditional SSO by adding an extra layer of security.\nRather than depending only on user login, passwords, and MFA at the identity provider, Portnox ZTNA uses certificate-based authentication to verify a certificate issued to the user on the specific device. This ensures that both the user and the device are trusted before access to web applications is granted.\nThis approach:\nPrevents attackers from accessing applications even if they have compromised user credentials and MFA. Although passwords and MFA are still used to log into the identity provider, they alone are insufficient to gain access to the application unless the attacker is using the device that holds a valid certificate for the user.\nEnhances security without adding complexity for the end user. Certificate verification happens automatically within the browser, requiring no additional action from the user.\nUses industry standards: SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC), which are supported by virtually all enterprise web applications that use SSO. Additionally, Entra ID’s Enterprise Application Management (EAM) is supported, allowing seamless access without requiring individual application configurations, as the process is managed directly by Entra ID’s identity provider.\nFollowing the initial setup, which typically involves copying and pasting addresses, identifiers, and certificates between the application’s configuration screen and Portnox Cloud, user access is then managed based on groups, policies, and risk assessment. For users, the only visible change during daily use is an additional screen at login confirming certificate verification.\nSecure access to private resources\nIn this section, you will learn how certificate-based authentication overcomes the limitations of VPNs by offering a significantly more secure way to access private applications on-premises or in private clouds.\nMany large organizations are actively seeking alternatives to traditional VPNs to securely provide remote access to private resources. Portnox ZTNA offers a breakthrough approach by combining certificate-based authentication with granular resource access and continuous risk assessment, delivering a level of security that meets the highest standards for private access.\nGranular access control: Unlike traditional VPNs, which typically grant users broad access to the entire network, ZTNA enforces strict, fine-grained policies that limit access to only the specific applications or resources the user is authorized for. This reduces the potential attack surface and prevents lateral movement within the network.\nCertificate-based authentication: ZTNA leverages strong, passwordless authentication using digital certificates installed on trusted devices. This verifies not only the user’s identity but also the security posture of the device itself, providing a much higher level of trust compared to username/password or even MFA alone.\nSimplified management: Centralized policy management in ZTNA solutions reduces administrative overhead. Unlike VPNs, which require complex configuration of gateways, tunnels, and network routing, ZTNA offers easier deployment and updates.\nImproved user experience: By automating certificate verification and eliminating the need for VPN clients, ZTNA provides seamless and transparent secure access. Users avoid complex login steps and network configurations, improving productivity and reducing support requests.\nFlexible Deployment: ZTNA supports secure access to both private cloud-based and on-premises resources without requiring extensive network redesign or complex VPN infrastructure, making it adaptable to diverse IT environments and hybrid cloud strategies.\nContinuous Risk Assessment (see: Risk assessment): Beyond initial authentication, ZTNA continuously monitors device health, security posture, and user behavior. Access can be automatically revoked or restricted if suspicious or risky activity is detected, helping to prevent compromised devices from gaining or maintaining access. VPNs lack this dynamic security layer. \nMeeting regulatory standards with certificate-based resource access\nIn this section, you will learn how certificate-based authentication with Portnox ZTNA helps organizations comply with key regulatory and security standards.\nRegulations such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO/IEC 27001 require strict control and monitoring of access not only to networks but also to critical resources and sensitive data. Portnox ZTNA uses certificate-based authentication combined with granular access policies to ensure that only trusted users and devices can reach specific resources, fulfilling these requirements. Comprehensive logging and continuous risk assessment provide the audit trails and ongoing security necessary for compliance and risk management.\nPCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Supports Requirement 8 (Identify and authenticate access to system components) by enforcing strong, certificate-based user and device authentication before resource access. Meets Requirement 10 (Track and monitor all access to network resources) through detailed logging of resource access and user activity.\nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Addresses the Security Rule’s Access Control Standard by restricting access to protected health information within resources to authorized users and secure devices only. Provides audit controls to monitor access and helps maintain data integrity by preventing unauthorized use.\nGDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): Helps meet Article 32 (Security of processing) by enforcing strict access controls on resources handling personal data. Audit logs created by ZTNA demonstrate accountability and support compliance with data protection principles.\nISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management): Aligns with Annex A.9 (Access Control) by requiring certificate-based authentication and policy enforcement for resource access. Supports Annex A.12.4 (Logging and Monitoring) with comprehensive records of user authentication and resource access events, enabling thorough audits.\nBy combining strong device and user authentication with granular, certificate-based access to resources, Portnox ZTNA simplifies compliance and improves security posture, all while reducing the complexity typical of traditional VPN and password-based solutions."

  "text": "Passwordless authentication\nIn this topic, you will learn what passwordless authentication is, why it offers stronger security and better user experience than traditional passwords, and how it is not a new idea but remains underused. You will also see how passwordless methods integrate with secure networking to reduce risks and improve access control.\nThe security gaps in passwords and multi-factor authentication\nIn this section, you will learn why passwords, while theoretically secure, are highly vulnerable in real-world use, and how even traditional multi-factor authentication can be bypassed through phishing, device compromise, or social engineering.\nPasswords were a solid idea when users had just one to remember and attackers lacked the computing power to crack them. But over time, systems multiplied and so did the number of passwords users had to manage. To stay secure, passwords became longer and more complex—harder to remember and easier to mishandle. As a result, people reuse them across services, choose weak ones that are easy to guess, or rely on predictable patterns based on personal information. This makes passwords a major vulnerability rather than a line of defense.\nNo visibility into reuse: There is no reliable way for an organization to verify whether a user has reused the same password on other personal or work-related systems, increasing the risk of compromise through credential stuffing or data breaches elsewhere.\nComplexity requirements backfire: Enforcing complex password rules (e.g. symbols, numbers, uppercase letters) may improve theoretical security, but in practice users often write them down, save them in unsecured files, or store them in browsers without proper protection.\nFrequent password changes lead to poor practices: When forced to change passwords regularly, users tend to modify the existing one slightly (e.g. adding a number or changing one letter), which results in weak variations that are easy to guess or crack.\nPassword managers are not a universal solution: While password managers help generate and store strong credentials, they are often too complicated or inconvenient for daily use by average users. Some cloud-based password managers have also suffered major security breaches, undermining trust.\nPhishing remains highly effective: Even strong, unique passwords can be stolen if users are tricked into entering them into fake login pages or malicious websites. Attackers often rely on social engineering rather than technical flaws to gain access.\nPasswords can be extracted from compromised devices: If a user’s device is infected with malware or already compromised, stored or entered passwords can often be retrieved by attackers regardless of their complexity.\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) was introduced as a solution to the problems with passwords. Initially, this meant sending one-time codes via SMS, but those were soon found to be vulnerable to SIM swapping and interception. Authenticator apps followed, offering stronger security, but even those can be bypassed in various ways. While MFA adds a layer of protection, it is not foolproof.\nSIM swapping and SMS interception: Attackers can trick or bribe mobile carriers into transferring a victim’s phone number to a new SIM card, allowing them to receive MFA codes sent via SMS.\nPhishing for MFA codes: Fake login pages can prompt users for both passwords and MFA codes, forwarding the credentials in real time to attackers.\nMan-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: Tools like reverse proxies can intercept login sessions and tokens, bypassing both passwords and MFA.\nMalware on the user’s device: If a device is already compromised, attackers can access MFA tokens, session cookies, or intercept authentication flows directly.\nPush fatigue (MFA fatigue attacks): In push-based MFA, attackers repeatedly send login approval requests to the user’s phone, hoping the user approves one out of annoyance or confusion.\nSolving password problems with passwordless authentication\nIn this section, you will learn what passwordless authentication is, the most common methods used today, and how these approaches work together to remove the risks and limitations of passwords entirely.\nPasswords can be guessed, stolen, or misused, but passwordless authentication removes them entirely from the login process, eliminating many of the most common attack paths. By relying on factors that are harder to steal or replicate, passwordless methods provide both stronger security and a better user experience.\nDevice-based certificates: A digital certificate installed on a trusted device is used to authenticate the user automatically, without the need to enter any secret. Certificates are hard to steal and can be revoked if the device is lost.\nBiometric authentication: Fingerprint scans, face recognition, or other biometrics ensure the person logging in is the authorized user. Biometrics are stored securely on the device and never transmitted.\nPhysical security keys: Physical keys act as a secure hardware-based method of proving identity. Even if the key is stolen, it often requires a user gesture (like a touch) to confirm use.\nPlatform-based authentication: These built-in systems link device identity, biometrics, and cryptographic keys to allow fast and secure authentication tied to the local device.\nWhen combined, for example, using device certificates with biometric verification, these methods create a strong, layered approach that significantly reduces the risk of compromise. Over the past decade, breaches involving compromised passwords have been widespread. In contrast, incidents involving breaches through passwordless authentication methods are exceedingly rare.\nHow digital certificates work in passwordless authentication\nIn this section, you will learn what digital certificates are, why they provide stronger security than passwords, how they are issued and managed, and how they enable secure, passwordless authentication for devices and users.\nDigital certificates for authenticating users and devices aren’t a recent innovation. They have been integral to secure communications since the 1990s, notably in SSH (Secure Shell) protocols, which began supporting them as an extension to address key distribution challenges.\nMajor operating systems like Windows and macOS have incorporated certificate-based authentication for years. Windows introduced support for X.509 certificates with its Certificate Services in Windows 2000, while macOS has utilized certificates within its Keychain Access system since at least macOS 10.4 Tiger, released in 2005.\nAlthough digital certificates have been around for a long time, many security solutions continue to rely on less secure authentication methods. Portnox Cloud fully supports certificate-based authentication and recommends it as a more secure alternative to traditional credential-based approaches.\nA certificate is issued and installed directly on a device, and the operating system prevents it from being copied or moved to another device. This ensures that only the specific device, or the authorized user on that device, holds that unique certificate, helping to tightly control access.\nIf a device with an installed certificate is lost, stolen, or compromised, the certificate can be revoked by the organization. Revoking the certificate means it will no longer be accepted for authentication, and a new certificate must be issued before the device can regain access once it is recovered.\nCertificates use strong cryptographic algorithms that make them practically impossible to forge or hack. This high level of security prevents attackers from creating fake certificates or impersonating authorized devices.\nOrganizations can issue certificates internally and distribute them to devices using various methods such as UEM/MDM tools, dedicated agents, or secure web portals. This flexible approach allows certificates to be used on many device types, including laptops, mobile devices, and certain IoT equipment, not just traditional computers and smartphones.\nWhile certificates verify that the device itself is trusted and a specific user account is logged in, they do not confirm the identity of the person using it. Because of this, certificates should be combined with local device authentication methods – preferably secure, passwordless options like biometrics – to confirm that the authorized user is the one accessing the device.\nSecuring networks with certificates, 802.1X, and RADIUS\nIn this section, you will learn how 802.1X and RADIUS work seamlessly with digital certificates to provide strong network security, and how all major operating systems across various devices support these standards, enabling nearly all computers and mobile devices to connect to networks using passwordless authentication.\nThe 802.1X protocol (see: Secure networks) was specifically designed to support passwordless authentication using digital certificates, enabling secure verification of both users and devices. Through the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and its communication with RADIUS servers, the network can authenticate devices based on their unique certificates, ensuring trusted access without relying on passwords.\nCertificates must first be installed on devices before they can be used for network authentication:\nThe organization uses Portnox Cloud to issue a certificate to the device or its user. Alternatively, certificates can be issued using the organization’s own certificate authority.\nCertificates are delivered and installed using UEM/MDM tools, the optional Portnox agent software (AgentP), or through the self-onboarding portal (recommended for IoT devices such as printers).\nThe certificate is securely stored on the device and is bound to that specific device or user. It can now be used for various authentication purposes.\nOnce installed, the certificate is used to authenticate the device on the network:\nThe user device (often referred to as the supplicant) requests network access using 802.1X by communicating with the NAS device, such as a switch or access point, which enforces 802.1X on a specific port (Ethernet) or SSID (Wi-Fi). The device then presents its certificate via EAP to the NAS device.\nThe NAS device contacts the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server and forwards the certificate for authentication. Portnox Cloud verifies the certificate’s validity, confirms the user’s or device’s identity against the authentication repository, checks for revocation, and then responds to the NAS device with a recommendation to either allow or deny access.\nThe NAS device enforces the decision based on the response from the RADIUS server.\nPasswordless access to cloud and on-prem applications and resources\nIn this section, you will learn how digital certificates can be used not only for network authentication, but also to control access to internal and cloud-based applications and resources.\nWhile securing access to the network is essential, the real goal is to protect the applications and resources that are part of that network, whether they’re hosted in the cloud or on-premises. Most cloud-based applications rely on identity providers like Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta Workforce Identity, while internal applications often require remote access through complex VPN setups that provide limited security control and visibility.\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) services like those from Microsoft, Google, or Okta allow users to access cloud-based applications without re-entering passwords, which improves user experience and reduces reliance on weak credentials. However, SSO alone doesn’t evaluate the device being used — meaning an untrusted, outdated, or compromised device can still access sensitive data.\nPortnox ZTNA extends this model by requiring the same certificate used for secure network access to also be presented by the browser during application access. This adds a strong device-based verification step before granting access, ensuring the device is recognized and trusted.\nTraditional VPNs are often the only way for users to reach internal applications or private cloud applications, but they come with downsides: they’re expensive, difficult to configure and maintain, and they provide broad access to the internal network once connected. This all-or-nothing approach means users who need access to just one internal service may end up with visibility into the entire network.\nPortnox ZTNA avoids this by authenticating access to specific applications using the same certificate used for Wi-Fi, wired networks, and SSO-based applications — allowing precise, certificate-based access to internal resources without exposing the rest of the network.\nOne certificate, issued and managed by Portnox or the organization, serves as a secure passport granting access not only to the network but also as an additional layer of security for SSO applications. It enables controlled access to on-premises and private cloud applications without exposing the entire internal network. Beyond simple authentication, this infrastructure also performs risk assessment, ensuring that devices are not just trusted but also free from compromise that could undermine security."

  "text": "Risk assessment\nIn this topic, you will learn how continuous risk assessment evaluates the security posture of devices and users, ensuring that access is granted only to trusted, uncompromised endpoints.\nThe risks behind network and application access\nIn this section, you will learn about the potential risks when a device attempts to connect to a network or applications, and the possible security consequences if these risks are exploited.\nDevices get compromised more easily than you might think. Sometimes, a simple misclick can install malware on a computer or mobile device. It could also be as easy as plugging in an infected USB stick or connecting to a rogue network cable. Once compromised, attackers can leverage everything the device has access to, including its security certificate that grants network or application entry.\nThis is why organizations need to assess multiple security conditions dynamically based on their risk tolerance. Some examples include:\nEnsuring the device has up-to-date system patches and antivirus software, firewalls, encryption, or verifying it only runs approved software and necessary security services.\nConfirming the device is enrolled in a UEM/MDM solution and actively managed, enabling continuous oversight of its security posture.\nDetecting whether the device blocks installations from untrusted sources or, for mobiles, isn’t jailbroken/rooted with elevated privileges that weaken security.\nConsidering the device’s geographic location, such as blocking access if detected in high-risk or hostile countries, which can also indicate theft.\nGranting access to a device, even when the user is authorized and a certificate is present, without evaluating these security conditions severely weakens the organization’s overall security. It only takes one vulnerable entry point for a major breach to occur, a lesson many organizations have already learned the hard way.\nContinuous risk assessment with Portnox AgentP\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox’s optional software, AgentP, helps assess and mitigate security risks, as well as what options are available if you prefer not to use AgentP.\nThe most reliable way to gather accurate security risk information from a device is by installing a secure agent on it. Portnox provides its own trusted agent, AgentP, which delivers all the essential functions an endpoint needs to fully utilize Portnox Cloud and ZTNA:\nContinuously assesses the security posture of the device in real time\nEnforces security policies and configurations on the endpoint\nRequests, installs, and manages digital certificates for authentication\nCommunicates securely with Portnox Cloud for risk evaluation and access decisions\nProvides detailed endpoint telemetry for centralized visibility and reporting\nIf you prefer not to install an additional agent on your devices, you can leverage Portnox’s integration with Microsoft Intune or Jamf to continuously monitor the security posture of your devices. These UEM/MDM systems perform ongoing security assessments and collect detailed device information.\nUsing the risk data provided by Intune or Jamf, Portnox Cloud and ZTNA can make access decisions based on whether a device is flagged as risky or secure. Although this method doesn’t offer the same depth of detail as the Portnox AgentP, it still allows effective risk-based control without adding extra software to your endpoints.\nIntegration with Intune and Jamf also enables you to request and install certificates on your devices through these UEM/MDM systems. However, you can also use many other UEM/MDM systems for that purpose, provided they support the SCEP protocol for certificate requests. Note that Portnox as of now does not provide risk assessment using other UEM/MDM software.\nEnforcement actions based on risk\nIn this section, you will learn what types of access enforcement actions can be taken based on the results of risk assessment and what happens after risk is remediated.\nPortnox Cloud and ZTNA offer different enforcement actions based on risk results. These actions control access at both the network level (like 802.1X) and application level (through ZTNA). Options include blocking network access completely, limiting access to certain VLANs or network parts (for example, a quarantine VLAN), restricting access to some applications, or allowing access but sending alerts.\nThe enforcement actions can be adjusted depending on the policy settings for the user’s group, the application, and the organization’s security rules and risk level. Some organizations block users or devices with any risk, others limit access to only safe networks or apps. Some just send warnings to admins but allow full access. This lets organizations be flexible depending on the situation. For example:\nFull access denied – for networks, the device cannot access the network at all. For apps or resources, access is fully blocked.\nLimited access – for networks, the device can only access certain VLANs or parts of the network like the Internet or low-risk networks. For apps or resources, access is only to those that are low-risk.\nAccess granted with warnings – the device and user can access networks and apps, but admins get alerts about the device’s risk level.\nIf a user is denied or has limited access, once the risks are fixed and the user or device tries again, Cloud will check the policies again and restore access. Cloud can also take automatic remediation actions to fix some risks on the device using AgentP, like turning antivirus back on.\nRisk management for unmanaged devices\nThis section explains how Portnox Cloud assesses and manages the security risks posed by unmanaged devices, such as contractor or BYOD devices that are not enrolled in a UEM/MDM system.\nIn many organizations, employees are allowed to use their own devices (BYOD), and there are often external workers such as contractors, auditors, consultants, or temporary staff who bring equipment managed by other companies and need to connect to local networks. These unmanaged devices can pose unique security challenges.\nPortnox Cloud provides a baseline solution by allowing such devices to connect via a guest network and captive portal, as well as through contractor accounts (see: Secure networks). Since devices connecting this way are not covered by risk assessment, administrators typically grant them minimal privileges needed to maintain network security. Risk assessment is not possible unless the device is enrolled with the company’s Intune/Jamf or has AgentP installed and enrolled.\nFor corporate users with BYOD devices, the user can quickly install AgentP and enroll using their regular corporate account. AgentP then monitors risk on the BYOD device just like on corporate-managed devices, allowing access only to resources deemed secure according to the group’s policies and risk level. This enables organizations to securely support BYOD usage, giving users the flexibility to use their own devices such as private mobile phones."

  "text": "Interoperability\nIn this topic, you will learn how secure networking and secure resources rely on strong integration with your existing software and systems, and what options Portnox provides to achieve this interoperability.\nSecure networking and secure resource access work only when systems are connected. If every network, application, or system required its own login, users would quickly fall back on weak practices – reusing, simplifying, or storing passwords insecurely. Linking systems so one secure authentication works everywhere removes these weak points, reduces friction, and enforces strong, consistent security.\nAdministrators face the same challenge. Managing each security platform in isolation makes it harder to spot issues and slower to respond. Direct integrations allow security data to flow into central tools such as SIEM, giving the security team a complete, real-time view without constant manual cross-checking. It also avoids duplication – for example, if the organization already uses Intune for risk assessment, that same intelligence can be applied to control network and application access.\nPortnox solves these problems. When a user signs in to their device with the organization’s central authentication, which could be through a third-party cloud service like Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta, the device is issued a unique certificate tied only to that user and that specific device – it cannot be moved or reused elsewhere. Once issued, it serves as the foundation for all other access: internal resources and third-party web apps all trust the same certificate. The network validates against the same certificate, so the user can connect to the company Wi-Fi or Ethernet and access applications without extra logins. Behind the scenes, integrated systems verify identity, check authorization, and assess device risk – while for the user, it simply feels like “it just works.”\nAuthentication repositories\nIn this chapter, you will learn how Portnox Cloud connects to authentication repositories (also called identity stores, user directories, or credential databases) to use their data for authentication and authorization, and how its internal repository can be used when no central system exists.\nIf administrators had to recreate every company user and assign new passwords just to provide access to the network and applications, the solution would be impractical. That’s why it’s essential for any network and application security solution to rely on users that the company already manages elsewhere.\nAll but the smallest companies use some kind of user repository, which is primarily used for logging in to computers as well as any SSO-enabled cloud applications the company currently uses (as an identity provider). For Windows environments, this is most commonly Entra ID, which integrates seamlessly with the operating system. However, this is not always the case. Some companies may use separate systems – for example, computer login might use one directory, while a Google Workspace suite handles email and cloud apps, requiring a second login.\nPortnox avoids adding yet another set of credentials. By integrating with your existing repository, Portnox Cloud allows users to authenticate to the network without needing a second or third password. Once integrated with a repository in Cloud, administrators can import all users or select groups, and assign them to relevant Cloud groups. This allows network access and application access to be managed independently from the repository’s internal group structure.\nPortnox Cloud supports all major industry-standard authentication repositories, including:\nEntra ID: Widely used in Windows-centric environments, providing seamless integration for devices and applications within Microsoft ecosystems.\nGoogle Workspace (GWS): Ideal for organizations that prefer Google services over Microsoft, enabling single sign-on and centralized user management across cloud-based applications.\nOkta Workforce Identity: Although less widespread, Okta has a strong niche in organizations that prioritize cloud-first identity management with flexible integration capabilities.\nActive Directory (AD): Supports traditional on-premises repositories, giving organizations that prefer not to rely entirely on cloud solutions the ability to manage users and groups locally.\nLDAP: For any other on-premises directories, Portnox supports LDAP connections.\nBoth AD and generic LDAP are supported via a custom agent that allows seamless integration with on-premises directories. Note that since AD and LDAP are not identity providers, they cannot be used for cloud application access control.\nCentralized event management\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox Cloud sends alerts and activity logs to SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems.\nPortnox Cloud integrates with major SIEM systems using universal standards, ensuring compatibility with both cloud-based and on-premises solutions:\nOffers direct HTTPS connections to well-known cloud providers, with Portnox continuously expanding integrations to additional third-party products.\nSupports the syslog standard, allowing alerts and logs to be sent to syslog collectors over UDP, TCP, or TLS. These collectors can then forward the data to SIEM systems. Syslog is supported by most cloud SIEM products.\nDelivers messages in JSON or CEF (Common Event Format), two widely recognized standards supported by most SIEM platforms.\nFor on-premises systems, provides a Docker container or uses the existing AD/LDAP agent to integrate with the cloud. The agent periodically retrieves data from the cloud and supplies it to the on-premises SIEM, allowing for integration with any on-premises SIEM solutions.\nPortnox has been tested with various SIEM systems, including Microsoft Sentinel, Rapid7 InsightIDR, Sumo Logic, Splunk, Datadog, Papertrail, Loggly, NXLog, and Kiwi Syslog Server. As long as a SIEM system supports industry standards, Portnox can integrate effectively.\nAdministrators can configure which alerts and events to forward to the SIEM, allowing them to filter out messages such as synchronization-completed alerts, ensuring that only required data is transmitted.\nEndpoint management\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox works with UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) and MDM (Mobile Device Management) systems to deliver device certificates using the SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) standard.\nThere are three ways to have Portnox Cloud issue certificates and deliver them to devices for passwordless authentication. One method requires distributing Portnox AgentP to devices, which some organizations may avoid due to concerns about adding extra agents. Another method requires the user to manually request a certificate through a web interface, which is not ideal for automatic enrollment. The third method leverages integration with existing UEM/MDM systems to automate certificate delivery without adding extra agents or requiring manual requests.\nUEM/MDM system already have an agent – either built into the operating system (for example, Intune works with Windows natively) or a background agent installed on the device. These agents handle standard management tasks, such as delivering configurations and installing or removing software, and can also manage certificates. Portnox indirectly uses these agents to enable automatic certificate issuance and delivery to devices.\nThe flow of certificate issuance via UEM/MDM works as follows:\nIf a device requires a certificate for a user or the device itself, the UEM/MDM system agent sends a configuration to the device.\nThe device then formally sends a SCEP request to Portnox Cloud using its operating system’s SCEP client, directed by the UEM/MDM agent. The UEM/MDM agent acts as an initiator by instructing the device’s operating system where to send the request and what information to include, such as an ID from the UEM/MDM system, which helps Cloud identify the user and device through its integration with the UEM/MDM system.\nPortnox Cloud receives the request, issues the certificate, and delivers it back to the device via SCEP.\nPortnox has been tested with many UEM/MDM systems and platforms, including the following:\nIntune\nGoogle\nJamf\nKandji\nAddigy\nWorkspace One\nSOTI\nMaaS360\nAs long as the operating system fully supports the SCEP standard, and the UEM/MDM solution has SCEP support for all operating systems, Portnox will work with them.\nWeb application access\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox ZTNA supports web applications using industry-standard single sign-on (SSO) methods.\nSingle sign-on (SSO) is a standard method for accessing web applications, and most organizations benefit from it. For example, users with company Entra ID credentials can access third-party cloud apps used by the organization without separate logins. Security can be further enhanced with certificate-based authentication, ensuring that only specific devices – or those that additionally meet risk assessment policies – can access these applications, without inconveniencing users.\nThe access flow with Portnox ZTNA works as follows:\nThe user accesses a web application that supports a custom SAML login. Typically, such applications provide a separate login button for custom SAML or recognize the domain secured by ZTNA from the supplied email address. After clicking the button or providing the email, the application redirects the user to ZTNA for preliminary checks.\nZTNA verifies the presence of a certificate stored in the operating system and accessible to the browser. If configured, it additionally retrieves device risk assessment information from the relevant agent to ensure compliance with security policies.\nIf the certificate and risk checks pass, control is forwarded to the organization’s identity provider – Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta. The user may then need to authenticate using the organization’s standard credentials, unless already authenticated in the browser.\nOnce authentication with the organization’s identity provider succeeds, access is granted to the application.\nThe ZTNA flow only introduces one additional step, which is minimally visible to the user. In the worst case, the user may need to click or confirm a certificate from a browser-displayed list, but in many cases, this step can be automated so that no interaction is required.\nPortnox ZTNA supports the global standards used to connect to other SSO identity providers:\nSAML – the de facto SSO standard supported by most web applications. If an app supports Entra ID or Google Workspace, it likely supports custom SAML as well.\nOIDC – an emerging SSO standard increasingly adopted by applications, though not yet as widely supported as SAML.\nEAM for Entra ID – enables support for any application with Entra ID integration, even if that application does not support custom SAML. This ensures Portnox ZTNA can secure all applications with basic SSO support when the organization uses Entra ID.\nPortnox ZTNA has been tested with over 55 popular business-oriented web applications, with Entra ID, Google Workspace, and Okta as backing identity providers for both SAML and OIDC.\nRisk assessment\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox Cloud uses information from other risk assessment platforms for its own risk assessment policies, allowing you to rely on these platforms’ agents for risk assessment without requiring AgentP.\nPortnox AgentP is a small, non-intrusive agent, but some organizations prefer to avoid deploying additional agents due to concerns about agent overload. Portnox Cloud addresses this need by providing the option to leverage existing risk assessment platforms.\nCloud policies can be defined in detail based on AgentP’s risk assessment categories, or administrators can simply trust another agent – meaning that if a device is managed by a specific product’s agent, Portnox considers it secure and relies on that agent to take any necessary action in case of risk. This approach allows security administrators to manage policies consistently in a single platform, avoiding duplication across multiple applications.\nSupported platforms include:\nIntune\nJamf\nAbsolute Secure Endpoint\nCrowdStrike Falcon\nFor some platforms, Portnox Cloud allows policies to simply verify that a device is managed by another security platform, trusting its risk assessment and the actions specified by the administrator. In other cases, Portnox can retrieve the device’s risk score from the external system and adjust the Portnox risk score accordingly.\nPortnox continuously monitors customer needs and adds support for new platforms as required. Initially, our focus was on integrating with the best-known industry-standard solutions, ensuring broad compatibility and reliable risk assessment coverage."

Then, if needed, change the default Session lifetime (hours) value. \nIf this setting is on, if a device loses connection to the local RADIUS server and reconnects within the session lifetime, it can authenticate quickly by providing a valid connection session ID. We recommend using this setting, along with higher priority for the local RADIUS server, for devices that need fast reconnection.\nNote: The session lifetime counts from the last successful connection, not the disconnection.\nOptional: In the Fast reauthentication section, click on the Enable Local cache checkbox to let the local RADIUS server authenticate devices on the basis of cached MAC addresses. Then, if needed, change the default Cache lifetime (hours) value. \nIf this setting is on, if a device loses connection to the local RADIUS server and reconnects within the cache lifetime, it is automatically authenticated if the local RADIUS server recognizes the MAC address. We recommend using this setting, along with higher priority for the local RADIUS server, for devices that need fast reconnection.

  "text": "Enable the RADIUS Change of Authorization feature\nIn this section, you will learn how to set up your environment to let Portnox™ Cloud send RADIUS CoA packets to your NAS devices from your local LDAP Broker installation.\nNote: This method is not recommended for new installations. Portnox Cloud originally sent CoA packets only from local AD Broker installations. However, many NAS devices limit the number of RADIUS servers to three, making it impossible to use redundant Cloud RADIUS servers, a local RADIUS server, and an LDAP Broker for CoA purposes. Therefore, we recommend to use the local RADIUS server Docker container instead.\nSet up and run a local instance of the Portnox LDAP Broker. \nFollow the instructions in the relevant topic:\nIntegrate with Active Directory through LDAP Broker\nIntegrate with OpenLDAP through LDAP Broker\nNote: If you want to send CoA packets but you don’t use Active Directory or OpenLDAP, you can use the following workaround: Set up a local AD/OpenLDAP server with an empty directory and connect the LDAP Broker to that empty directory. To send CoA packets, the LDAP Broker does not need access to your corporate directory, you just need a locally running application that communicates with the Portnox Cloud. However, to install LDAP Broker, you have to connect it to a directory, and so you need the empty LDAP directory for that purpose.\nConfigure RADIUS on your NAS devices. \nAs your highest priority RADIUS server, configure the Cloud RADIUS server closest to your location. \nOptional: As your next priority RADIUS server, configure the second Cloud RADIUS server (if you selected the International (geo-redundancy) option when you created your tenant). \nOptional: As your next priority RADIUS server, configure the local RADIUS server (if you use the local RADIUS server). \nIf you need very fast response times, you can set up the local RADIUS server with higher priority than the cloud servers, but you will have less detailed logs, and any changes that you make in Portnox Cloud will be visible to your devices only upon cache expiration.\nNote: If your NAS device limits the number of RADIUS servers to three, you must skip either this step or the previous step (second Cloud RADIUS server).\nAs your lowest priority RADIUS server, configure the LDAP Broker installation as follows: \nAs the IP address of this RADIUS server, provide the IP address of the server where you installed the LDAP Broker.\nAs the authentication port and the accounting port, you can use any port numbers that are not used by the server where you installed the LDAP Broker.\nAs the shared secret, use the same shared secret as the first configured Cloud RADIUS server.\nThe LDAP Broker is not a RADIUS server, but you must configure it in the NAS device so that the NAS device can accept CoA packets coming from this server. Since you configure it with the lowest priority, the NAS device never contacts it when attempting to authenticate connections. That is why the authentication port and the accounting port are never used (they are used only if the NAS contacts the RADIUS server).\nWith this configuration, Portnox Cloud performs the following steps when you change the access policy settings:\nPortnox Cloud determines the devices that the policy settings apply to.\nThe next time that the LDAP Broker polls the cloud (default: every 30 seconds), it receives instructions to send CoA packets to specific NAS devices.\nThe LDAP Broker sends the RADIUS CoA packets to NAS devices in the local network.\nThe NAS devices react to the CoA packets by contacting Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers to re-authenticate (in order of priority configured in the NAS).\nAfter authentication, the NAS devices receive information from the RADIUS servers about VLANs/ACLs they should use."

  "text": "Glossary\n802.1X\n802.1X is a networking protocol that enables secure AAA control. When a device (called a supplicant) first contacts a NAS (called an authenticator), it is only allowed to authenticate. The NAS sends the device’s authentication information to a RADIUS server (called an authentication server) that verifies the credentials provided by the device. If the credentials are valid, the authentication server responds to the authenticator, which then lets the supplicant connect to the network. The authentication server can also suggests that the authenticator uses a specific VLAN to connect the supplicant.\n802.1X operates at the data link layer and supports multiple EAP authentication methods. It prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the network by enforcing authentication before network access is granted. The protocol is commonly used in wired and wireless LANs for port-based network access control.\nNote: In spoken language, 802.1X is often pronounced as “dot-one-ex”.\nAAA: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\nAccounting\nAccounting lets you collect information locally on a network device and send it to the server for billing, auditing, and reporting. It lets you track and keep a log of every management session used for access.\nAccounting records details such as session start and stop times, duration, data usage, and actions performed. This data helps in monitoring network usage, detecting anomalies, and generating usage reports for compliance and operational analysis.\nAgentless\nAgentless is a common industry term that means checking endpoint compliance without installing a special software agent. This method uses existing tools or built-in features on the device to gather information.\nIn Portnox Cloud, the term agentless means no Portnox AgentP is installed on the device. Instead, compliance data is collected through built-in agents like the Windows Intune agent or agents from other UEM or MDM software. These existing agents provide the necessary information without needing an extra agent.\nAuthentication\nAuthentication is the process of verifying the identity of the person or device accessing your network. It involves validating credentials such as usernames and passwords, digital certificates, or cryptographic tokens. Authentication ensures that only authorized users or devices can gain access, providing the first layer of security before authorization and access control are applied.\nAuthorization\nAuthorization is the process of checking what the user is authorized to do. For example, RADIUS and TACACS+ authorize users for specific rights by associating attribute/value pairs, which define the rights and the appropriate users.\nCIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)\nClassless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method of allocating and managing IP addresses more efficiently. Instead of using traditional class-based addressing, CIDR allows for flexible allocation of address space by using a slash notation (e.g., /24) to indicate the number of network bits in an IP address, allowing for better utilization of available addresses and easier routing.\nCIDR notation combines the IP address with a prefix length to define network and host portions. It supports aggregation of multiple IP ranges into a single routing entry, reducing the size of routing tables and improving routing efficiency across the internet and private networks.\nDHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)\nDHCP is a protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration details (like subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers) to devices when they join a network. This removes the need for manual IP configuration, making network management more efficient and less error-prone. DHCP is one of the core services in most enterprise and home networks and is typically handled by routers, dedicated DHCP servers, or wireless controllers.\nWhile DHCP plays a critical role in configuring devices at the network layer (Layer 3), it is not involved in access control decisions. It operates independently of authentication protocols such as 802.1X and RADIUS, which are handled at Layer 2 before IP address assignment. In Portnox Cloud, DHCP is used only after a device has successfully connected – its traffic is analyzed to help fingerprint the device based on patterns typical of specific device types or manufacturers. This post-authentication analysis supports functions like device identification and MAC spoofing detection.\nEAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)\nThe Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework. It offers different EAP methods, which are specific authentication protocols, such as EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, EAP-MD5, and EAP-TTLS. EAP is used in 802.1X communications. EAP packets are encapsulated in EAPoL (EAP over LAN) messages. EAPoL makes it possible to carry EAP packets between the client device (supplicant), the access point (authenticator), and the authentication server (RADIUS server).\nEAP itself does not define authentication mechanisms but provides a standard way to transport authentication information. It supports mutual authentication, dynamic key generation, and flexible use in wired and wireless networks. EAP messages are exchanged during the network access control process before granting network access.\nEndpoint compliance\nEndpoint compliance is a common industry term that refers to checking if a device meets specific security rules before it is allowed to access a network (security posture assessment). These rules may include having updated software, antivirus protection, and proper configuration. Devices that do not meet these requirements are considered non-compliant.\nCompliance checks are typically performed using software agents installed on the device. These agents collect information about the device’s security status, such as operating system updates, installed applications, and security settings. Some devices may use built-in management agents provided by their operating systems to report compliance data. The collected information is compared to policy requirements to determine if the device is compliant.\nFast reconnect\nFast reconnect, also known as EAP session resumption, is a function that lets devices reconnect quickly to the NAS. When fast reconnect is supported by a device and enabled on the RADIUS server, the device sends a session identifier to the RADIUS server via EAP, after it authenticates with the NAS for the first time. If the device then loses connection to the NAS, it sends the recent session identifier. If the RADIUS server recognizes this session identifier, and the session is still valid (depending on session lifetime), it immediately authenticates the device. This reduces the time and resources required for authentication, for example, it eliminates the need to connect to authentication repositories after every reconnection.\nFast reconnect relies on caching session keys and identifiers both on the client and the RADIUS server. It supports quicker re-establishment of encrypted sessions without repeating the full EAP authentication exchange, improving connection speed and reducing authentication server load. Session validity is controlled by configurable timeouts.\nIAM (identity and access management)\nIdentity and access management is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies used to manage digital identities and control user access to resources within an organization. IAM ensures that the right individuals have the appropriate access to technology resources at the right times and for the right reasons.\nIAM systems handle user authentication (verifying identity), authorization (defining access rights), and account management tasks such as creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts. IAM supports security requirements by enforcing access policies, monitoring user activity, and enabling compliance with regulations. It often integrates with identity providers (IdPs) and supports protocols like SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for single sign-on (SSO).\nIdP (identity provider)\nAn identity provider (IdP) is a system that performs user authentication and provides identity information to other systems or applications. It is a central part of single sign-on (SSO) setups, where users log in once through the IdP and then gain access to multiple services without logging in again.\nIn SAML-based SSO, the IdP generates and sends a SAML assertion to confirm the user’s identity. In OpenID Connect (OIDC), the IdP handles the login and issues an ID token that includes the user’s identity details. The applications that rely on the IdP to verify users are called service providers (in SAML) or clients (in OIDC). The IdP ensures consistent and secure user authentication across systems. Common identity providers include Microsoft Entra ID, Google Identity Platform, Okta, Ping Identity, and Auth0.\nIoT (Internet of Things)\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects physical objects, like devices with sensors and communication abilities, to the Internet. These objects can collect and share data without humans having to control them directly. There is no formal definition of whether the physical device is an IoT device or not. For the purposes of Portnox Cloud, we use the term “IoT device” to refer to any devices that are not directly used by humans, do not have user accounts, but still form part of the network. This includes devices like printers, scanners, surveillance cameras, air conditioners, and any other networked devices in the company offices that might be connected to the company network.\nIoT fingerprinting\nFingerprinting is the process of identifying a device based on unique characteristics it exposes, rather than relying on user-provided credentials or certificates. These characteristics can include network behavior, protocol patterns, hardware identifiers, and other metadata. Fingerprinting is commonly used in security and networking.\nPortnox uses fingerprinting to identify and classify IoT devices. This is done by analyzing the MAC address to determine the manufacturer and then examining DHCP traffic patterns. Many devices send DHCP requests in a predictable and characteristic way, based on their operating system or firmware. By matching these patterns to known profiles, Portnox can determine the actual type and identity of a device with high accuracy.\nFingerprinting is also used to detect MAC spoofing attempts. If a device connects using a MAC address that has already been seen on the network, Portnox checks its fingerprint against the one previously associated with that MAC. If the DHCP behavior does not match, the device is assumed to be an impostor, and access is denied. This helps protect against attackers who manually assign a known MAC address to their own device to bypass access controls.\nIPSK (Identity Pre-Shared Key)\nIPSK (Identity Pre-Shared Key) is a Wi-Fi authentication method supported by major manufacturers’ access points, which allows multiple pre-shared keys (PSKs) on the same SSID. Each key can be linked to a specific device or user and checked against a RADIUS server. For devices using MAB, IPSK improves security by requiring both the MAC address and a PSK to match. This prevents MAC spoofing since just copying the MAC address isn’t enough to connect.\nIPSK integrates with RADIUS servers to validate credentials and enforce policies per user or device. It allows centralized management of multiple keys and provides better control over Wi-Fi network access compared to traditional single PSK methods.\nNetwork access layers\nNetwork access layers refer to the different ways devices can connect to a network: wireless, wired, and VPN. These layers define how devices establish communication and access network resources using technologies like Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or virtual private networks (VPNs).\nEach access layer has specific protocols and security mechanisms. Wired access typically uses Ethernet with IEEE 802.3 standards. Wireless access uses IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards and includes encryption methods like WPA3. VPN access creates secure tunnels over public networks using protocols such as IPSec or SSL/TLS to protect data in transit.\nLDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)\nThe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a protocol used for managing and accessing directory information within a computer network. LDAP organizes information about users, such as names, contact details, and other relevant data. The term is also often used to describe servers that store directory information and make it accessible using this protocol.\nLDAP operates over TCP/IP, typically on ports 389 (unencrypted) and 636 (encrypted with SSL/TLS). It uses a hierarchical structure similar to X.500 but simplifies communication by using the simpler LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF). LDAP supports searching, modifying, adding, and deleting directory entries and is widely used for authentication and authorization services.\nMAB (MAC Authentication Bypass)\nMAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) is a workaround method to connect devices to 802.1X networks. In an 802.1X network, devices are typically required to authenticate using a username and password, digital certificates, or other authentication methods before gaining access to the network. However, there may be scenarios where certain devices, such as printers, IP phones, or other IoT devices, do not have the capability to perform the standard 802.1X authentication. To accommodate such devices, network administrators can pre-configure a list of approved MAC addresses for specific devices, allowing them to bypass the usual authentication process and gain network access directly. The NAS devices will then check the MAC address of the connecting device against the pre-approved list, granting access to the devices that match the allowed MAC addresses. Note that the NAS devices must support MAB authentication for this to be possible.\nMAB operates by sending the device’s MAC address as a username to the RADIUS server for authentication. It provides limited security compared to 802.1X because MAC addresses can be spoofed. MAB is often used as a fallback method when 802.1X authentication fails or is unsupported by the device.\nMAC address (Media Access Control)\nA MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication within a local network. It is a 48-bit address expressed in hexadecimal format and is typically associated with Ethernet or Wi-Fi devices. The MAC address is used by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to map IP addresses to physical MAC addresses in order to make it possible for devices to communicate on the network.\nMAC addresses consist of two parts: the first 24 bits identify the device manufacturer (OUI), and the last 24 bits are assigned by the manufacturer as a unique device identifier. MAC addresses operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and are essential for local network traffic delivery.\nMAC spoofing\nMAC spoofing is the act of manually changing the MAC address of a network interface on a device in order to impersonate another device on the network. Since many access control systems rely on MAC addresses for identification, spoofing allows an attacker to potentially bypass security restrictions by mimicking an authorized device. Most operating systems and network cards support changing the MAC address, making this type of attack relatively easy to carry out.\nTo detect and block MAC spoofing, Portnox Cloud compares additional device-specific indicators beyond the MAC address itself. When a device connects using a known MAC, the system examines its network behavior – specifically, DHCP traffic patterns – and matches it against the expected fingerprint for that MAC. If the fingerprint does not match the previously observed profile, Portnox assumes the device has been spoofed and blocks its access, raising an alert.\nNAS (network access server)\nIn the context of RADIUS, the network access server is a device or software component that provides a point of entry for users to access a network. It acts as a gateway between the user’s device and the network infrastructure. The NAS is responsible for receiving and processing user authentication requests, forwarding them to the RADIUS server, and relaying the server’s response back to the user. Typically, NAS devices include network equipment such as routers, switches, wireless access points, VPN servers, or even dedicated NAS devices. They are responsible for controlling user access to network resources, enforcing security policies, and managing network connections.\nNote: The NAS acronym also stands for network-attached storage, but we never use it in this context in Portnox Cloud and its documentation.\nOIDC (OpenID Connect)\nOpenID Connect is an identity protocol commonly used for single sign-on (SSO). Like SAML, it allows users to authenticate once through a trusted external system and then access multiple applications without repeated logins. OIDC is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which is a widely used standard for granting access to resources without sharing user passwords.\nOAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows a user to give an application access to specific data or services hosted by another system, without exposing their login credentials. OIDC extends this by adding authentication, confirming who the user is. In OIDC, the application (called the client) redirects the user to an identity provider (IdP), which handles the login. If successful, the IdP returns an ID token containing verified identity information. The client uses this token to establish a secure session with the user.\nOUI (organizationally unique identifier)\nAn OUI is the first part of the MAC address, specifying the manufacturer of the device. OUIs are controlled by the IEEE, who assign unique codes to manufacturers. They are also called MAC prefixes or Ethernet prefixes.\nAn OUI consists of 24 bits (three bytes) written as the first six hexadecimal digits of a MAC address. It is used by network tools and monitoring systems to identify device vendors and can be looked up in public IEEE registration databases.\nPolicy enforcement\nPolicy enforcement is the process of defining and applying rules that control network access based on factors such as user roles, device types, location, and time. These rules determine what resources a user or device can access.\nFor example, a policy might restrict a contractor’s laptop to only connect to the guest Wi-Fi network and block access to internal company resources. Enforcement ensures that network access follows the organization’s security requirements.\nRADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)\nRADIUS is a network protocol that lets you manage access to your networks. Network devices such as switches and access points can use RADIUS to authenticate and authorize devices trying to connect to the network such as computers, mobiles, and IoT.\nRADIUS works over UDP and combines authentication, authorization, and accounting in a single process. It uses a client server model where the network device acts as a client and forwards user credentials to a central RADIUS server.\nRadSec (RADIUS secure)\nRadSec is a security extension for the RADIUS protocol, adding a layer of encryption. This is achieved by encapsulating RADIUS messages within a TLS (Transport Layer Security) tunnel. RadSec is a standard defined in RFC 6614, but is currently supported by a limited number of NAS devices.\nRadSec uses TCP as transport instead of UDP and provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity for RADIUS traffic. It is commonly used across untrusted networks such as the public internet to secure communication between RADIUS clients and servers.\nSAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)\nSAML is a standard protocol used for single sign-on (SSO). It allows users to log in once through a central system and then access multiple services without needing to log in again. This is commonly used in organizations to manage access to cloud applications and internal systems.\nIn a SAML setup, the central login system is called the identity provider (IdP). The service the user is trying to access, such as an application or website, is called the service provider (SP). When a user tries to access the service, they are redirected to the IdP to log in. After successful login, the IdP sends a secure message called an assertion back to the service provider. This assertion contains information that proves the user’s identity. The service provider uses this information to decide whether to allow access.\nSCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol)\nThe Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is a commonly used communication protocol that allows devices to seek and obtain digital certificates from a certificate authority (CA). It secures and simplifies the process of enrolling for and managing certificates. SCEP is used by integrated endpoint management solutions to distribute Portnox Cloud certificates as part of automatic device onboarding.\nSCEP is an HTTP-based protocol defined in an IETF draft. It supports certificate signing requests, certificate retrieval, and certificate renewal. It uses shared secrets for initial authentication and is supported by many network devices, mobile device management systems, and public key infrastructure products.\nSSO (single sign-on)\nSingle sign-on is a login method that lets users access multiple systems or applications with one set of credentials. Instead of logging in separately to each service, users authenticate once and gain access to all connected services without needing to enter their username and password again.\nSSO works by using a central system, often called an identity provider (IdP), to handle authentication. When a user tries to access a service, the service redirects the user to the IdP. If the user is already logged in, the IdP confirms the user’s identity and sends that information back to the service. This allows the user to access multiple services securely and efficiently using a single login session.\nTACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)\nTACACS+ is a Cisco extension to the TACACS network protocol that centrally manages authentication, authorization, and accounting for network devices like switches and routers, ensuring secure access control and administrative control. It is often compared to RADIUS. The main difference between RADIUS and TACACS lies in their functionalities, where RADIUS focuses on authentication and accounting, while TACACS+ provides additional features like granular access control and command authorization for enhanced network security and administrative control.\nTACACS+ uses TCP as transport on port 49 and encrypts the entire payload of each packet. It separates authentication, authorization, and accounting into distinct processes. It is commonly deployed on network access servers and device consoles for centralized administrator login and auditing.\nTenant (software)\nA tenant is an instance of a software application or service that is used by a specific group or organization. Each tenant has its own isolated environment and is logically separated from other tenants, so the organization data is private and secure.\nA tenant can exist in cloud platforms and SaaS products. For example, an Entra ID tenant is a dedicated and isolated instance in Microsoft Entra ID used for identity, access, and resource management and is linked to a company domain and subscriptions. A Portnox Cloud tenant is a separate cloud instance where an organization manages network policies, connected devices, and user authentication independently from other organizations.\nX.500 Directory Specification\nThe X.500 Directory Specification is a standardized protocol used in IT to structure and manage information within a directory service. This specification follows a hierarchical model where data is stored in a tree-like structure. For instance, an entry like \"CN=Kosh Naranek, O=Vorlon Corp, C=US\" would be organized within this structure, containing attributes such as Common Name (CN) representing the person’s name, Organization (O) detailing the company name, and Country (C) indicating the United States. X.500 is the basis for modern directory services like LDAP, ensuring orderly data storage and easy information management in networks.\nX.500 defines the directory information tree, distinguished names, schema for object classes and attributes, replication of directory data between servers, and distributed directory access using the Directory Access Protocol and Directory System Protocol. It is standardized in ITU-T recommendations X.500 to X.599 and operates over OSI protocols.\nZTNA (zero trust network access)\nZero trust network access is a common industry term for a security framework that requires verification of user and device identity before granting access to network resources, including for example web applications and other services. It enforces access based on least-privilege principles and continuous authentication, regardless of network location. ZTNA replaces traditional perimeter-based security with strict access control using user identity, device posture, and contextual information.\nPortnox ZTNA is a product that implements this framework by enforcing access policies through continuous verification of device compliance and user credentials. It integrates with network infrastructure and authentication systems to apply dynamic, context-based access controls. Access is granted only when devices and users meet predefined security requirements."

This new dashboard layout framework will allow us to release additional dashboard widgets in the future, while giving each customer the ability to determine which widgets are most important to them.\nCoA (Change of Authorization) has been incorporated into the latest version of our local RADIUS Docker container. This will allow everyone to utilize CoA, not just those using Active Directory. You will also no longer need to choose between CoA or RADIUS redundancy, as this functionality is incorporated directly into the same RADIUS container. Existing customers leveraging LDAP Broker for Change of Authorization will remain unaffected, and CoA will continue to function as it always has. We do, however, recommend all customers begin planning to leverage the local RADIUS docker container for CoA in the future.\nAAA Troubleshooting Logs now include a live mode, similar to live tail (tail -f) in Linux. This live mode can be used in conjunction with filters to greatly simplify the troubleshooting process, allowing you to see only those events you’re interested in as they happen, without needing to constantly refresh the page. Live mode can also be paused any time, so you are never overwhelmed with a flurry of new incoming events.\nAgentP for Apple silicon – A new version of AgentP for macOS with native support for Apple silicon (Mx Series processors) will begin slowly rolling out shortly following the 2024.03 release. This new version of AgentP will no longer require Rosetta be enabled on your M-Series macOS device.

When both user and device certificates are used and no one is logged into the machine, only the machine itself is authenticated to the network using the device certificate. You may configure that device to be assigned to a different VLAN or ACL for least privilege, ensuring the device is still able to be managed remotely and receive updates, but nothing more. Once a user logs into the machine, the device will re-authenticate to the network using that user’s certificate, assigning the correct ACL or VLAN that will allow that user to access only the resources on the network that are needed.\nIt is now possible to add individual users from an Authentication Repository to Portnox Cloud groups. No longer do you need to coordinate with whomever manages the identity provider in your environment to have custom groups created for specific use cases. Instead, the Portnox Cloud admin can add one or several different individual users to any Portnox Cloud group themselves, just as easily as adding groups. You can even combine groups and individual users from any authentication repository into any Portnox Group.\nThose working with large lists of MAC Addresses for MAB accounts will notice some significant usability improvements, such as the ability to search for MAC address, and filter options such as vendor and expiration.\nmacOS and Windows minimum supported versions can now be defined as part of a Risk Policy, similar to iOS and Android.\nThe TACACS+ service is now available as an optional Docker container for both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures. This allows the TACACS+ service to be deployed in virtually any public cloud IaaS, such as AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. The TACACS+ service can now also be deployed on low-cost, solid state, micro computers, such as the Raspberry Pi.\nThe Portnox Cloud login page has received a sexy new redesign to provide a fresh new look and improved performance.\nAlert messages now include the NAS display name the authenticating device is connected to.\nWhen an Intune integration app secret expires, it is now possible to update that secret directly from within the Portnox Cloud portal.\nAAA logs may now be exported to W3C formatted text files for troubleshooting, reporting, or archival purposes.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.7\nUpdate published on: Jul 10, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nGroup improvements\nThe Groups page has been completely redesigned to allow now allow the ability to re-order group priority order through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.\nThe Group Edit page has also been completely redesigned to improve readability, scannability, and overall useability by making the layout of the page simpler and more intuitive. \nPortnox Cloud admin account management\nPortnox Cloud Admins now have a dedicated area under [Settings > Account Settings] where the admin can change their password, update their name, subscribe/unsubscribe to email alerts, and configure MFA. Previously, these could only be completed on behalf of the admin by another Portnox Cloud admin.\nMFA authenticator support\nPortnox Cloud admins can now utilize Authenticator applications such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, LastPass Authenticator, etc. as a more secure alternative to SMS for second factor authentication to the Portnox Cloud portal.\nWPA3 Enterprise 192-bit mode support\nWPA Enterprise 192-bit mode can now be used for enhanced security on all operating systems and devices where it is supported.\nWindows 10, version 2004 (build 19041) and Windows Server 2022 or later\nAndroid 10 or later\nApple IOS 14.6 or later\nmacOS on Apple silicon only\nLinux machines running NetworkManager 1.30 or later\nAgentP configures 802.1X on wired interfaces\nAgentP can now automatically configure wired Ethernet adapters for 802.1X as they are added to the system via USB, docking stations, etc.\nAzure Marketplace\nPortnox Cloud is now available through the Azure Marketplace.

E.g. searching for 192.168.0.2 will function as it always has, returning 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.22. However, searching for '192.168.0.2' in quoted notation will return only 192.168.0.2.\n5xx & 4xx error pages now include direct links to Portnox status and support pages.\nAuthentication failures for unsupported MSCHAPv2 authentication type no longer creates device objects or consume device entitlements.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.5\nUpdate published on: May 29, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nIoT device trust (new feature)\nDetect and automate remediation actions for MAC address bypass (MAB) spoofing attacks Entra ID Integration (improvement).\nCloud administrators can now renew the token used for their Entra ID application integration.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.04\nUpdate published on: Apr 24, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nSecure Syslog over TLS has been added as a new protocol for forwarding alerts to SIEM solutions.\nNew Devices/Accounts page is now default (you are still able to switch for old page).\nAll links (e.g. from Alerts) are now routed to the new Devices/Accounts page.\nA feature for saving the filter has been added to the new Devices/Accounts page.\nFixed an issue with deleting multiple devices.\nFixed sorting.\nAdded a preview for device-based accounts, so users can verify the results of a query.\nImproved concurrent editing of MAC-based accounts.\nAPI tokens can now be used with external authentication repositories.\nAuthentication region has been added to SIEM alerts.\nImprovements on repository synchronization to reduce alerting noise.\nLicensing improvement to not count device twice, when two certificates are used on the same machine.\nFixed the subscription expiration alert to show the correct amount of remaining days.\nPortnox Cloud Update 2023.3\nUpdate published on: Mar 27, 2023\nNew features and improvements in this release\nIoT device type accounts – Utilize IoT fingerprint information to automate and orchestrate those devices access to the network. For example, assign all Roku and Apple TV streaming devices to VLAN 44.

  "text": "How do RADIUS servers work in Portnox Cloud?\nIn this topic, you will learn the difference between cloud RADIUS and local RADIUS servers in Portnox™ Cloud.\nTo secure network connections, your network devices need to communicate with AAA servers. The most common protocol used by these servers is RADIUS. Portnox Cloud lets you run Cloud RADIUS servers dedicated to your organization as well as local RADIUS servers that act like proxies.\nHow do Cloud RADIUS servers work?\nPortnox Cloud has two RADIUS server farms in the Azure cloud. One in the United States and one in Netherlands.\nWhen you create your Portnox Cloud account, you select if you want to use just one of those locations (for legal reasons) or both of them. This setting cannot be changed later.\nIf you choose both locations, you can configure your NAS devices to use just one of the two servers (for example, depending on the geographical location) or both of them (for example, prioritizing the one that is closer).\nThere is no difference between the two server farms except for their location. Both farms have real-time access to all your Portnox Cloud data and both offer the same quality of service and bandwidth.\nWhen you create a Cloud RADIUS server instance, you receive a unique combination of an IP address and two port numbers. This combination is not used by any other Portnox Cloud customers – it’s an instance that is dedicated to you.\nIf you configure your NAS devices to use Cloud RADIUS servers, user/IoT devices attempting to connect to the network managed by these NAS devices will cause the NAS device to contact the Cloud RADIUS server to authenticate the user/IoT device.\nCloud RADIUS servers work for you 24/7, unless you have Internet connectivity problems. To have access to cloud RADIUS functions even when your NAS devices have no connection to the Internet, see below: How do local RADIUS servers work?\nCloud RADIUS servers work in N+2 redundancy mode. That means that there are at least 3 instances (main and two backups) running 24/7, in each of the geographical locations, to cover for any potential problems with one of the instances.\nHow do local RADIUS servers work?\nThe local RADIUS server is an optional component that you can install manually in your local network.\nThe local RADIUS can be deployed as a secure virtual machine running on Tiny Core Linux or a Docker container. When you start it, it downloads the configuration from the cloud and starts responding to RADIUS queries on configured local IP address and ports. There is no remote administration, and any changes made in the console have no effect on the server at all.\nThe local RADIUS server communicates with the activated Cloud RADIUS server that is geographically closest. For example, if you have both Cloud RADIUS servers activated and your office with the local RADIUS server is in Europe, the local RADIUS server will communicate with the European Cloud RADIUS server.\nThe local RADIUS server works as a cache. If a client device connects to the local RADIUS server and the local RADIUS server has no information about this device, it will get that information from the Cloud RADIUS. If the same client device connects to the local RADIUS server later, within the fixed cache expiration time (7 days), the local RADIUS server replies with the cached information without contacting the Cloud RADIUS. If you deploy the local RADIUS as a virtual machine, the cache is stored in persistence memory on the local drive and reloaded after a reboot (for example, if the local RADIUS server crashes or there is a power outage).\nEvery hour, the local RADIUS servers synchronize their cache with all other local RADIUS servers configured in the tenant. For example, if one local RADIUS server has cached information about a specific device, all other local RADIUS servers for the same tenant will also get cached information about this device from Cloud RADIUS. Also, during this hourly synchronization, all entries that are more than 7 days old are purged.\nWhen your local RADIUS server cannot connect to the Cloud RADIUS server (for example, during an Internet outage), your NAS devices receive only information about known devices. You cannot register any new devices in Portnox Cloud until the local RADIUS server can connect to the Cloud RADIUS server. If the local RADIUS cannot contact the cloud RADIUS server, it will not delete any cached information, and so cached information may stay in the local RADIUS cache indefinitely until a connection to the Cloud RADIUS server is reestablished.\nThe local RADIUS server also has a fast session resumption cache, with a cache lifetime that is configured when creating or editing the local RADIUS server in Portnox Cloud. This is an EAP session resumption mechanism, completely unrelated to the primary RADIUS cache function, which lets client devices resume their network connection quickly when roaming between wireless access points. This cache only stores MAC addresses of the client devices and lets you avoid the full EAP re-authentication process when reconnecting.\nYou should configure the local RADIUS on your NAS devices as first priority, higher than the priority of Cloud RADIUS server or servers. This allows the local RADIUS to act as a cache. If your NAS devices connect to the Cloud RADIUS servers and not to the local RADIUS server, there will be no cached information in the local RADIUS server in case of an outage. The downside of this setup is that you will have less detailed logs, and any changes that you make in Portnox Cloud will be visible to your devices only upon cache expiration."

  "text": "Onboard a Windows device with AgentP in multi-user mode\nIn this topic, you will learn how to onboard using Portnox™ AgentP, a Windows 10 computer with multiple users, and a Wi-Fi or wired network managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nImportant: Before you turn on multi-user mode or switch from user certificates to computer certificates, prepare your Entra ID or Active Directory groups correctly. If AgentP starts using computer certificates to authenticate computers, and you did not configure your computer accounts to be part of an Entra ID or Active Directory group that is mapped to a Portnox Cloud group, Portnox Cloud will assign all newly created computer accounts to the Default group. If you did not configure the Default group to allow network access, computers will lose network connectivity.\nFor more information on multi-user mode, see the following topic: AgentP and certificates.\nIntegrate Portnox Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID or local Active Directory. \nEnable AgentP multi-user mode in Portnox Cloud settings: \nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the AgentP Enrollment Policy section, click on the Edit link. Then, activate the Enable AgentP Multi-User (Windows OS only) checkbox and click on the Save button. \nNote: If you are working in a hybrid environment with Entra ID and Active Directory, by default, Portnox Cloud uses credentials from Entra ID for automatic enrollment. To use Active Directory credentials instead, activate the Prefer Active Directory over Entra ID during unattended enrollment checkbox.\nEnsure that in your Portnox Cloud group the networks are configured to use both user and computer certificates. \nDownload and install Portnox AgentP \nEnroll AgentP Automatically. \nSelect User mode, and activate the Keep automatically enrolled switch \nRun AgentP and switch the operating system user to test if AgentP changes to a different user. \nAgentP needs a few seconds to switch to a different user. You can see the logged in user in the About tab of the AgentP user interface.\nTo speed up the process of switching to a new user, you can click on the Sync now button in the About tab of the AgentP interface.\nImportant: If AgentP is already installed and enrolled manually, before you switch to unattended mode, you must manually unenroll it by clicking on the Deactivate button in the AgentP user interface. Otherwise, AgentP will remain enrolled with the manually onboarded user and will not automatically switch to the current Active Directory or Entra ID user."

  "text": "Testing the Portnox Cloud REST API\nIn this topic, you will learn how to test the Portnox™ Cloud REST API by using the interface in the Portnox Cloud web portal.\nAuthorize with the Cloud API\nTo use the Portnox Cloud API, you must first authorize with the API. Without authorization, all other API operations will fail. In this section, you will learn about two ways to authorize.\nOption 1: Authorize using your Portnox Cloud administrator account. \nGo to the screen. \nIn the AVAILABLE AUTHORIZATIONS window, in the Basic authorization section, enter your Portnox Cloud administrator Username and Password. \nNote: You cannot authorize with the API using external authentication providers such as Microsoft Entra ID or Google Workspace. You must use a locally managed Portnox Cloud administrator account.\nWarning: Portnox Cloud does not check your credentials at this stage. You will only know if you used a correct username and password once you start performing operations with the API.\nClick on the Close button. \nOption 2: Authorize using your API key. \nGo to the screen and in the CLOUD API TOKENS section, click on the Generate token link to generate a new API token (key). \nIn the GENERATE A NEW TOKEN window, enter the Name for this token and select whether the token Never expires or expires On date. Then, click on the Generate token button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon to copy the value of the token and paste this value into a temporary text file. \nNote: This is the only time you can copy the token value. If you close this window, you will not be able to copy this value later. If you forget to copy the value, you must delete the current token and create a new one, and then copy the value of the new one.\nClick on the Close button. The token will be listed in the CLOUD API TOKENS section. \nGo back to the screen and click on the Authorize button. \nIn the AVAILABLE AUTHORIZATIONS window, paste the value of the token (key) that you copied earlier into the Value field in the apiKey section, and then click on the Authorize button. \nTest the Portnox Cloud REST API\nIn this section, you will perform example operations using the Portnox Cloud REST API to see how it works.\nThis example shows how to use the /api/device/list operation to fetch a list of accounts and their devices.\nWarning: In this example, we selected an operation that does not change the state of the tenant. However, all actions performed in the Portnox Cloud REST API test interface () are actual API operations. All operations that change states, such as creation or deletion operations, actually change the configuration of your tenant. Be careful when executing these operations to test the API.\nClick on the Device Operations heading to expand this section and then click on the /api/device/list tile to expand this operation. \nOptional: You can click on section headings above the Parameters section to see code samples in different languages. \nIn the Parameters section, click on the Try It Out button. \nIn the request section, click on the Model link to learn how to modify values in the request, then click on the text field and modify values as needed, and finally click on the Execute button. \nAnalyze the Responses section. \nTest using Postman\nIn this section, you will do the same test as above, but using the Postman application.\nPostman is a free, GUI-based Windows application for testing APIs. Before you begin, download Postman from the official site and install it. You can register for a Postman account or run the application without an account.\nEnter the URL of the API method in the Enter URL or paste text field and set the HTTP method. \nTo create the URL of the API method, concatenate the URL of the Portnox Cloud API: https://clear.portnox.com:8081/CloudPortalBackEnd with the API method.\nFor example, for the /api/device/list, use the following URL:\nhttps://clear.portnox.com:8081/CloudPortalBackEnd/api/device/list\nand select the POST method.\nEnter your authorization data in the Authorization tab. \nIn the Type field, select the Bearer option. \nIn the Token field, paste your Portnox Cloud API key. \nNote: In this example, we are using the API key to authorize. To use your Portnox Cloud administrator user name and password, select Basic Auth as the Type.\nEnter your request JSON code in the Body tab. Then, click on the Send button. \nIn this example, we are using the same JSON code as in the section above:\n{ \"Query\": { \"PageNumber\": 0, \"PageSize\": 10 } }\nResult: You receive a response from the Portnox Cloud API. You can view the response code in the Pretty tab.\nTest using curl\nIn this section, you will do the same test as above, but using the curl application.\ncurl is a free application, available for many operating systems, and used to send HTTP requests and get HTTP responses from the command line. Before you begin, download curl from the official site (choose the right package for your operating system) and install it.\nGet the curl request from Portnox Cloud or from Postman. \nYou can write your curl request on your own, or you can get it directly from the Portnox Cloud API testing interface or from Postman.\nIf you want to get your curl request from Portnox Cloud, after you execute your request in the Portnox Cloud API testing interface, copy the content of the Curl field.\nFor example:\ncurl -X POST \"https://clear.portnox.com:8081/CloudPortalBackEnd/api/device/list\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer AITmunk3KfUCSpcKE9CHqhulhlk\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{ \\\"Query\\\": { \\\"PageNumber\\\": 0, \\\"PageSize\\\": 10 }}\"\nIf you want to get your curl request from Postman, after you prepare your request in Postman, click on the </> icon, select cURL in the field below, and click on the ⧉ icon to copy the curl code.\nFor example:\ncurl --location 'https://clear.portnox.com:8081/CloudPortalBackEnd/api/device/list' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer AITmunk3KfUCSpcKE9CHqhulhlk' \\ --data '{ \"Query\": { \"PageNumber\": 0, \"PageSize\": 10 } }'\nNote: The curl code from Postman is optimized for the UN*X/Linux shell and may require changes on Windows.\nExecute the curl command in your command line window on your operating system. \nResult: You receive a response from the Portnox Cloud API."

  "text": "Turn on MAC address spoofing protection by IoT fingerprinting\nIn this topic, you will learn how to turn on and use MAC address spoofing protection in Portnox™ Cloud.\nMAC spoofing is a malicious attack method in which the attacker modifies an Ethernet interface’s MAC address on their device to correspond with another device’s MAC address. If certain devices on your network are authorized based only on their MAC addresses, the attacker can unplug the approved device from the network and connect their own device, gaining the same level of network access as the original device.\nPortnox Cloud MAC-based authentication detects such attacks and can either raise an alert or disconnect the rogue device. Portnox Cloud functionality called IoT fingerprinting records the device DHCP fingerprint, which is unique, and then checks if the device has the same fingerprinting when connecting again.\nFor IoT fingerprinting to work, the device must use DHCP to request an IP address, and you must have a DHCP forwarder on the same subnet. When the device connects to the network, it broadcasts its DHCP request in the subnet. The DHCP forwarder picks up the broadcast and forwards it to the Portnox Cloud IoT fingerprinting servers.\nTurn on IoT fingerprinting\nIn this section, you will turn on the IoT fingerprinting functionality in Portnox Cloud™, which is necessary for MAC spoofing protection to work.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nIn the right-hand side pane, under the Agentless IoT Device Fingerprinting heading, click on the Edit link. \nClick on the Enable Agentless IoT Device Fingerprinting checkbox to activate it, and then click on the Save button to save the configuration. \nTurn on MAC spoofing protection\nIn this section, you will turn on the MAC spoofing protection for a specific Portnox Cloud™ MAC-based account.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Devices option. \nClick on the row that represents a MAC-based account and then click on the Edit button above to edit the account settings. \nOn the account settings screen, scroll down to the IoT Device Trust section, activate the Enable IoT Device Trust checkbox, and then click on the Save account button in the top-right corner of the screen. \nThe IoT Device Trust (MAC spoofing protection) functionality can function in one of two different modes:\nSend a warning alert if this account is suspected of being the victim of MAC spoofing. Devices under this account will still be allowed access to the corporate network.\nBlock devices from accessing the corporate network and send an alert if this account is the victim of MAC spoofing.\nIn this example, we’re using alerts only. To use the second option and block devices from accessing the network, you need to enable the RADIUS Change of Authorization feature by following the steps in this topic: Enable the RADIUS Change of Authorization feature.\nSet up the DHCP forwarder\nIn this section, we will set up a DHCP forwarder to forward DHCP broadcasts to the Portnox™ Cloud IoT fingerprinting servers.\nNote: If you are worried that forwarding DHCP packets without encryption may be a security risk, note that a DHCP request contains no sensitive information. DHCP requests are broadcast traffic that goes to every endpoint on the network segment. This is true of any network that client accesses, including any hotspots. The only possible identifying information would be the MAC address, but MAC addresses are not truly unique and cannot be used to identify the user or organization. Therefore, DHCP forwarding is not a security risk.\nYou have two options to set up a DHCP forwarder:\nIf you have a Layer 3 device such as a router and this device has DHCP forwarder functionality, you can set this device to forward DHCP broadcasts to the Cloud IoT fingerprinting servers. The device must be connected to the same subnet as the devices to be fingerprinted. If you choose this option, follow the device manufacturer instructions to set up DHCP forwarding and forward all DHCP requests to one or both of the following IP addresses on port 67:\n20.241.131.45 if you use the United States RADIUS server\n20.4.128.229 if you use the Europe RADIUS server\nNote: The device that acts as a DHCP forwarder cannot act as a DHCP server at the same time.\nIf you do not have a Layer 3 device that can be used for DHCP forwarding, you can set up a physical or virtual machine on the same subnet to act as a forwarder. Portnox provides a Docker container with all the necessary functionality.\nYou can also use the Portnox DHCP forwarder if your firewall blocks port 67. The forwarder communicates with the Portnox Cloud servers on port 167 instead.\nIn this example, we show you how to configure the Portnox DHCP forwarder Docker container on an Ubuntu virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox.\nInstall Docker on the virtual machine, if not yet installed. \n$ sudo apt install docker.io\nImportant: While the Ubuntu apt repository includes Docker, for production machines Docker recommends using its own apt repository instead. This gives you access to newer versions and additional packages. You can find the relevant instructions in the official Docker documentation.\nImportant: If Docker is already installed, skip this step. If you don’t have a physical or virtual machine to install Docker, you can get a third-party Linux image. For example, you can download the latest Ubuntu image from the Linux VM Images project and import it into your hypervisor.\nPull the Portnox DHCP forwarder Docker image. \n$ sudo docker pull portnox/portnox-dhcp\nRun the Portnox DHCP forwarder. \nsudo docker run -d --read-only --net=host \\ --name portnox-dhcp-relay portnox/portnox-dhcp:latest \\ -i eth0 -r 20.4.128.229:167\nNote: In this example, the forwarder is sending the data to the European Portnox IoT fingerprinting server. Use the following IP address and port to forward to the United States server instead: 20.241.131.45:167.\nOptional: Monitor the Portnox DHCP forwarder logs. \n$ sudo docker logs portnox-dhcp-relay -f\nOptional: To automatically update the Portnox DHCP forwarded to the newest version as soon as it is available, install the portnox-autoupdate Docker container, as instructed in the following topic: Automatic updates for all Docker containers. \nTest the forwarder connection\nIn this section, you will use the Packet Sender application to test the connection between the forwarder and Portnox Cloud IoT fingerprinting servers.\nTo make sure that your forwarder can connect to the Portnox Cloud servers, or to troubleshoot IoT fingerprinting problems, we recommend that you test if the UDP packets are reaching their destination. For this, we recommend that you use the open-source Packet Sender application.\nIn this example, we will install the Packet Sender application on the Ubuntu virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox. This is the same machine that is running the DHCP forwarder.\nInstall Packet Sender. \n$ sudo apt install snapd $ sudo snap install packetsender\nRun Packet Sender. \nSend an echo UDP packet to the Portnox Cloud IoT fingerprinting server. \nIn the ASCII field, type echo. \nIn the Address field, enter the Portnox Cloud IP that you want to test (20.241.131.45 or 20.4.128.229). \nIn the Port field, enter 167. \nNote: You can also use Packet Sender to test the connection to port 67, if you want to use a physical device as your DHCP forwarder.\nSelect UDP as the packet type. \nClick on the Send button. \nObserve the log section below. \nYou should see two entries: one will be the packet that you sent, and the other will be the echo reply. If you only see one entry, port 167 is probably blocked on your firewall.\nTest the MAC spoofing protection\nIn this section, you will attempt MAC spoofing to test if Portnox MAC spoofing protection is working correctly.\nTo test MAC spoofing protection, you need two devices and you need to know how to change the MAC address of the second device to mimic the MAC address of the first device. In this example, we used a macOS laptop as the original device, and a Windows laptop as the spoofed device.\nFind the MAC address of the Ethernet interface of the first device. \nIn this example, we used a macOS device, and checked the MAC address by using System Preferences: \nThe discovered MAC address is: 24:1B:7A:F9:5B:DC.\nAdd the MAC address of the Ethernet interface to the MAC-based account. \nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Devices option. \nClick on the row that represents a MAC-based account and then click on the Edit button above to edit the account settings. \nIn the Allowed MAC addresses section, click on the Add new MAC address link. \nIn the CREATE NEW MAC ADDRESS window, enter the MAC address of the test device with a description that lets you easily identify and remove it later. Then, click on the Save button. \nFor example, add the MAC address 24:1B:7A:F9:5B:DC with a description: MAC spoofing test.\nClick on the Save account button in the top-right corner of the screen. \nConnect the first device to the switch and check for an alert on the Portnox Cloud Alerts screen. \nChange the MAC address of the Ethernet adapter of the second device. \nIn this example, we used a Windows laptop, and changed the MAC address to the MAC address of the first device (24:1B:7A:F9:5B:DC) by doing the following:\nIn the search bar, start typing network connections and select the View network connections option above. \nRight-click on the icon that represents the Ethernet interface and select the Properties option from the context menu. \nIn the Ethernet Properties window, click on the Configure button. \nIn the Ethernet adapter Properties window, go to the Advanced tab. \nIn the Property list, find the Locally Administered Address entry, click on it, and in the Value field on the right-hand side, enter the MAC address to spoof. \nFor example: 241B7AF95BDC\nConnect the spoofed device to the switch and check for an alert on the Portnox Cloud Alerts screen."

  "text": "Does the Blast-RADIUS vulnerability affect Portnox Cloud users?\nWhat is the Blast-RADIUS vulnerability?\nThe Blast-RADIUS (BlastRADIUS) vulnerability (CVE-2024-3596) is a vulnerability in the RADIUS protocol (RFC 2865).\nThis vulnerability is considered very low risk for Portnox Cloud for the following reasons:\nThe research is purely theoretical and no attacks in the wild have been observed.\nThe attack would require an attacker to assume a man-in-the-middle position between the NAS device and the RADIUS server, so either within the customer’s infrastructure or within the ISP infrastructure.\nThe attack requires high computational power to calculate an MD5 collision before the RADIUS timeout.\nThe attack affects only direct UDP communications with the RADIUS server. The 802.1X protocol is not affected.\nWhich parts of Portnox Cloud could be affected?\nNot affected:\nNetwork authentication using credentials or certificates is not affected because it uses the 802.1X protocol.\nLocal RADIUS servers are not affected. All communications between the local RADIUS server’s virtual machine or container and the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers are conducted through secure TLS tunnels.\nTACACS+ services are not affected. All communications between the TACACS+ local virtual machine or container and the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers are conducted through secure TLS tunnels.\nZero Trust Network Access is not affected. All communication with the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers is conducted internally within the Portnox secure infrastructure.\nAny devices and software that use the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute in RADIUS communications are not affected.\nCould be affected:\nMAC-based authentication (MAB), if your NAS device does not use the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute. While most NAS devices support this attribute, you may need to upgrade those NAS devices to the latest firmware version. We recommend checking with your NAS manufacturer and immediately install any new firmware, if available.\nVPN authentication, if your VPN server does not use the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute. We recommend that you check with your VPN server manufacturer and immediately install any new firmware or security patches.\nWhat can I do to protect myself better?\nWhile the risk of Blast-RADIUS is very low, you may do the following to protect yourself:\nIf using Portnox Cloud for 802.1X authentication only (credential-based or certificate-based network access): No action needed. You are not affected.\nIf using Portnox Cloud for TACACS+ only: No action needed. You are not affected.\nIf using Portnox Cloud for Zero Trust Network Access only: No action needed. You are not affected.\nIf using Portnox Cloud for MAC-based authentication: \nOption 1: Configure your NAS devices and your Portnox Cloud RADIUS for RadSec communications. For more information, see the topic: Configure advanced RADIUS server options.\nOption 2: If the latest firmware of your NAS device supports the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute, update the firmware of your NAS device to the latest version.\nOption 3: Install a local RADIUS server within your local network as close as possible to the NAS devices, and configure your NAS devices to use this local RADIUS server as your primary RADIUS server. Then, all RADIUS communications between your infrastructure and the Portnox infrastructure will be conducted through a secure TLS tunnel. Note that with this solution, an attack is still possible, but only from the inside of your infrastructure (if the attacker is able to modify the traffic between your NAS devices and your local RADIUS server).\nIf using Portnox Cloud for VPN authentication: \nOption 1: Configure your VPN server and your Portnox Cloud RADIUS for RadSec communications. For more information, see the topic: Configure advanced RADIUS server options.\nOption 2: If the latest firmware or software version of your VPN server supports the Message-Authenticator RADIUS attribute, update the firmware or software of your VPN server to the latest version.\nOption 3: Install a local RADIUS server within your local network as close as possible to the VPN server, and configure your VPN server to use this local RADIUS server as your primary RADIUS server. Then, all RADIUS communications between your infrastructure and the Portnox infrastructure will be conducted through a secure TLS tunnel. Note that with this solution, an attack is still possible, but only from the inside of your infrastructure (if the attacker is able to modify the traffic between your VPN server and your local RADIUS server).\nNote: The blast-RADIUS issue lies within the RADIUS protocol itself, and only the proper configuration of NAS devices can guarantee security against this vulnerability. While our server could achieve complete immunity by requiring the Message-Authenticator attribute, this would unfortunately make it incompatible with many NAS devices that have not yet implemented this support. Therefore, for devices that already support this attribute, we recommend a firmware upgrade, and for those that are not yet compatible with the Message-Authenticator attribute, we recommend that you consider using RadSec."

  "text": "How does the dashboard map widget determine a device’s location?\nThe interactive map widget on the Portnox Cloud Dashboard shows device locations, but they may not be exact.\nIf Portnox Cloud can obtain exact geolocation information, for example, from AgentP installed on a mobile device (if, during installation, the user allowed to share their geolocation information with AgentP, and if geolocation services on the mobile device are active), then the map location is exact and based on this geolocation information. However, the location is updated once an hour, not in real time.\nIn most cases, there is no geolocation data for an endpoint device (such as a desktop computer with no GPS module) or there is no way to obtain geolocation information from the device (such information is not part of network communication, and is not tracked by authentication repositories). In such cases, Portnox Cloud can only get geolocation information from the public IP address of the device, which is usually managed by the Internet service provider (ISP), and points to the ISP’s network center, not to a specific endpoint location."

If you get a message Test is unsuccessful, check your configuration values and also check the status of your Airwatch Cloud Connector – either make sure it is disabled, or enabled and deployed.\nClick on the SAVE AND ADD TEMPLATE button to save this configuration and proceed to adding a SCEP request template. \nIn the Certificate Template – Add/Edit pane: \nIn the Name field, type a name for this template. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP Template, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP configuration you just created. \nIn the Subject Name field, enter the variables that Workspace ONE UEM will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn this example, we used the format CN={EmailAddress}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nIf you are using device-based certificates, use a device-related value such as CN={DeviceSerialNumber} instead. This will let Portnox Cloud create Cloud accounts for new devices, and the value of this variable will be used as the name for such accounts. In this case, new Portnox accounts for new devices will be named after the device’s serial number so you can identify the devices in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Private Key Length field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Private Key Type field, select both checkboxes. \nOptional: In the SAN Type field, click on the +Add button to add a new SAN entry. Then in the left-hand side field for the new SAN entry, select the User Principal Name option, and in the right-hand side field, type {EmailAddress}. \nNote: This step is necessary for user-based certificates. If you are using device-based certificates, you can skip this step because Portnox Cloud creates device-based Portnox accounts using the value in the Subject field, not the SAN field.\nThe variable in this field must match a value from the authentication repository in Portnox Cloud, which uniquely identifies the user or the device. This is the value on the basis of which the Portnox Cloud SCEP server will know for which user or device it should issue a certificate.\nIn this example, we used the variable {EmailAddress}, which generates the UPN SAN on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn the Automatic Certificate Renewal field, we recommend that you select the ENABLED option and in the Publish Private Key field, we recommend that you select the DISABLED option. \nThese values will not directly affect the integration. They apply to your certificate renewal management and security preferences. Adjust them to your needs, if necessary.\nClick on the SAVE button to save the template. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA and the SCEP request template.\nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Workspace ONE team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Workspace ONE to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Workspace ONE, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the Base-64 encoded X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nCreate a profile for Android\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Workspace ONE UEM for Android devices. This profile will contain the necessary certificates as well as SCEP and Wi-Fi configurations.\nIn the Profiles pane, click on the Add button and select the Add Profile option. \nIn the Add Profile pane, click on the Android icon. \nIn the Name Your Profile field, enter a name for the profile. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud Android Profile, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type credentials, and then click on the SEARCH button. Then, click on the ADD button in the Credentials row. \nIn the Credentials section: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Defined Certificate Authority option. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP CA configuration you created earlier. \nIn the Certificate Template field, select the name of the SCEP request template you created earlier. \nClick on the ADD button under the Credentials heading to add another credentials payload. \nIn the second Credentials section: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Upload option. \nIn the Certificate section, click on the CHOOSE FILE button and select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier. Then, click on the ATTACH CERTIFICATE button. \nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type wi-fi, and then click on the SEARCH button. Then, click on the ADD button in the Wi-Fi row. \nIn the Wi-Fi section: \nIn the Service Set Identifier field, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nActivate the Set as Active Network switch. \nIn the Security Type field, select the WPA/WPA2 Enterprise option. \nIn the SFA Type section, select the TLS option. \nIn the Identity Certificate field, select the Credentials 1 option. \nIn the Root Certificate section, activate the Credentials 2 checkbox. \nImportant: Newer Android versions may also require you to fill in the Identity and Domain fields, even if the values you input here are effectively ignored and the actual information is acquired from the certificate fields. The Identity field can contain any string, and the Domain field should specify the corporate domain supported by your authentication repository.\nCheck if your summary information is the same as on the screenshot, and then in the bottom-right corner of the profile pane, click on the NEXT button. \nIn the Assignment section, select the Smart Group as needed to push this profile to correct devices, configure any other options as needed in your environment, and then click on the SAVE & PUBLISH button. \nResult: You created a profile for Portnox Cloud and Android devices.\nAfter you created your profile, you can use your regular Workspace ONE UEM procedures to push it to managed devices immediately and see if it works correctly. For information on managing devices, pushing profiles, and troubleshooting, consult the Workspace ONE UEM documentation."

  "text": "Onboard Chromebooks with certificates using Google Workspace and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud certificates via Google Workspace SCEP to manage Chromebook (ChromeOS) devices.\nImportant:\nBefore you can deploy Portnox Cloud certificates via Google Workspace and SCEP, you must complete the following steps:\nIntegrate Portnox Cloud and Google Workspace\nPrepare a physical or virtual Windows server that can access Portnox Cloud SCEP services (has access to the Internet), where you will install the Google connector.\nMake sure that the Google administrator account that you will use for this configuration has the Shared Device Settings privileges.\nDownload and install the Google connector\nIn this section, you will download and install the Google Cloud Certificate Connector software on a Windows server. Google Workspace needs this connector to connect to the Portnox™ Cloud SCEP server.\nWhen a device managed by Google Workspace needs a certificate to connect to a managed network, the Google Cloud creates a SCEP request for that device. The Google Cloud Certificate Connector, running on a Windows server, polls the Google Cloud for any new requests every 30 seconds. If it finds a new request, the connector contacts the SCEP server, gets the certificate, sends it back to Google Cloud, and then Google Cloud propagates the certificate to the managed device.\nDo the following steps on the Windows server prepared earlier.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/scep. \nClick on the DOWNLOAD CONNECTOR link to download the Google connector. Then, follow the installation steps to complete installation. \nIn Step 2 of Google instructions, click on the DOWNLOAD button to download the connector configuration file (config.json). \nIn Step 3 of Google instructions, click on the GENERATE KEY button to generate and download the connector key (key.json). \nMove the downloaded files (config.json and key.json) to the installation folder as indicated by Google during the installation. \nOpen the Windows Services application, find the Google Cloud Certificate Connector service, right-click on it, and select the Start option from the context menu. \nIf the service doesn’t start, check if the user that you selected earlier has privileges to log on as a service ().\nGoogle connector logs are visible in the Event Viewer under .\nIf you need to change the connector configuration, for example, download a new key, place new files in the installation directory and restart the service.\nNote: If the Event Viewer shows warnings with the following description: Invalid JWT: Token must be a short-lived token (60 minutes) and in a reasonable time frame, check if your Windows server clock is synchronized with the universal clock.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the step in which you get the Cloud SCEP URL and password.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate from the Cloud portal and convert it to the Base-64 encoded X.509 format.\nYou need the root CA certificate so that your managed devices can verify the validity of Cloud RADIUS servers, which have certificates signed by this root CA certificate. If the root CA certificate is not distributed to managed devices, some devices may show a security warning each time that the user connects to networks managed by Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nIn Windows, double-click on the downloaded file.

Then, close the Certificate window. \nDownload the tenant CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud tenant CA certificate from the Cloud portal and convert it to the Base-64 encoded X.509 format.\nYou need the tenant CA certificate from Portnox Cloud so that your managed devices can verify the validity of individual SCEP certificates, which are signed using the tenant CA certificate.\nNote: You must convert the downloaded certificate to the Base-64 encoded X.509 format because the certificate that you download is in the binary X.509 format, and Google Workspace only accepts Base-64 encoded certificates.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nIn the Trusted Root Certificates section, click on the Download PFX link, then save the downloaded file. \nThe default name of the file is Your_tenant_name - Portnox CLEAR.pfx, for example, Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR.pfx.\nCopy the value of the Issued to field in this section to a text file. You will need it when you create a Wi-Fi profile in Google Workspace. \nIn Windows, right-click on the downloaded file and select Open from the context menu. \nThe file will be opened in the Windows certificate manager.\nIn the certificate manager window, open the Certificates section in the left-hand pane and then double-click on Your_tenant_name - Portnox CLEAR in the right-hand side pane. \nIn the Certificate window, click on the Details tab and then click on the Copy to File button. \nIn the Certificate Export Wizard, export the certificate in base-64 encoded format. \nIn the first step of the wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the second step of the wizard, select the Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) option. \nIn the third step of the wizard, select a file to save the exported tenant CA certificate, and click on the Next button. \nFor example, save the file as tenantCertificate.cer.\nIn the last step of the wizard, click on the Finish button. Then, close the Certificate window. \nCreate a profile for the root CA certificate\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Google Workspace for the downloaded Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/certificates. \nIn the Organizational units section, select a specific organizational unit if you want this profile to apply only to the selected organizational unit. Otherwise, leave the default top organizational unit selected. \nClick on the ADD CERTIFICATE link. \nThe Add certificate pane opens.\nIn the Add certificate pane, enter the name for the profile and then click on the UPLOAD button. Then, select the root CA certificate downloaded and converted earlier. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud root CA, but you can use any name you like.\nYou will see basic information about the root CA certificate.\nIn the Certificate Authority section of the Add certificate pane, select Chromebook and optionally all other managed device platforms that you will use this certificate with, and then click on the Add button. \nResult: You created a profile for the Portnox Cloud root CA certificate.\nCreate a profile for the tenant CA certificate\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Google Workspace for the downloaded Portnox™ Cloud tenant CA certificate.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/certificates. \nIn the Organizational units section, select a specific organizational unit if you want this profile to apply only to the selected organizational unit. Otherwise, leave the default top organizational unit selected. \nClick on the ADD CERTIFICATE link. \nThe Add certificate pane opens.\nIn the Add certificate pane, enter the name for the profile and then click on the UPLOAD button. Then, select the tenant CA certificate downloaded and converted earlier. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud tenant CA, but you can use any name you like.\nYou will see basic information about the tenant CA certificate.\nIn the Certificate Authority section of the Add certificate pane, select Chromebook and optionally all other managed device platforms that you will use this certificate with, and then click on the Add button. \nResult: You created a profile for the Portnox Cloud tenant CA certificate.\nCreate a secure SCEP profile\nIn this section, you will create a secure SCEP profile in Google Workspace. The secure SCEP profile lets devices managed by Google Workspace contact the Portnox™ Cloud SCEP server via the connector.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/scep. \nIn the Organizational units section, select a specific organizational unit if you want this profile to apply only to the selected organizational unit. Otherwise, leave the default top organizational unit selected. \nClick on the ADD SECURE SCEP PROFILE link to create a secure SCEP profile. \nThe Add Secure SCEP pane opens.\nNote: Adjust the values proposed below to your requirements and your environment, if needed.\nIn the Device platforms section of the Add Secure SCEP pane, activate the Chromebook (user) checkbox. \nImportant: When managing Chromebooks using Google Workspace, you can only use user certificates for your Chromebooks with Portnox Cloud. This is because Google Workspace does not create device-based accounts in its authentication repository, so there is no way for Portnox Cloud to know your list of devices and to be able to authenticate based on any device identifiers. This also means you cannot use SCEP-based authentication in the managed guest mode, which is not associated with any Google user.\nIn the SCEP profile name section, enter the SCEP profile name for this secure SCEP profile. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP User, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Subject name format section, select the Fully Distinguished Name option. \nIn the Common name field, enter ${USER_EMAIL} as a variable to set subject common names for generated certificates. \nOptionally, in other fields, enter text information relevant to your organization. \nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the Custom option. Then, click on the + icon to add SANs and add a User Principal entry with the ${USER_EMAIL} variable string. \nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for the identity information in the SAN UPN field. You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nIn the Key usage section, select the Key encipherment option. \nIn the SCEP server attributes section: \nIn the SCEP server URL field, copy and paste the SCEP URL that you saved in the previous task in this series. \nIn the Extended key usage field, select the Client authentication option. \nIn the Challenge type field, select the Static option and then copy and paste the SCEP password that you saved in the previous task in this series. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the tenant CA certificate profile that you created in the earlier task. \nNote: Do not select the root CA certificate here. The root CA certificate is used in the Wi-Fi profile to confirm the identity of the Cloud RADIUS servers.\nIn the Network type this profile applies to field, activate the Wi-Fi checkbox. \nFor other fields, leave the default values or adjust values to your requirements and your environment, if needed. \nClick on the Save button to save your secure SCEP profile. \nResult: You created a trusted SCEP profile.\nNote: If you are trying to add a trusted SCEP profile but no profiles appear in the list, check if your Google Workspace has an active Chrome Enterprise Upgrade subscription. Trusted SCEP profiles are available only with the Chrome Enterprise Upgrade.\nCreate a Wi-Fi profile\nIn this section, you will create a Wi-Fi profile in Google Workspace for Chromebooks managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/wifi. \nIn the Organizational units section, select a specific organizational unit if you want this profile to apply only to the selected organizational unit. Otherwise, leave the default top organizational unit selected. \nClick on the ADD WI-FI link. \nThe Add Wi-Fi pane opens.\nIn the Platform access section of the Add Wi-Fi pane, activate the Enabled checkbox in the Chromebooks (by user) section. \nIn the Details section, enter a friendly name for the Wi-Fi profile in the Name field and enter the network SSID in the SSID field. \nNote: The value of the Name field is used only in Google Workspace for organizational purposes. Users see the network SSID in their Chromebooks network configuration.\nIn the Security settings section, in the Security Type field, select the WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (802.1X) option and in the Extensible Authentication Protocol field that appears, select the EAP-TLS option. \nIn the Server Certificate Authority field, select the root CA profile you created in the earlier task.. \nNote: This root certificate is used to validate the RADIUS server. Do not select the tenant CA certificate here. The tenant CA certificate is used in SCEP profiles to verify the validity of SCEP certificates.\nIn the Username field, enter the username for administering the network. \nYou can use any username you like. This field is required by Google Workspace but it is not used in practice.\nIn the SCEP profile field, select the trusted SCEP profile you created in the earlier task. \nIn the Issuer pattern section, in the Common name field, paste the issuer name that you copied from Portnox Cloud in the earlier task. \nFor other fields, leave the default values or adjust values to your requirements and your environment, if needed, then click on the SAVE button to save the Wi-Fi profile. \nResult: You created a Wi-Fi profile for the network managed by Portnox Cloud.\nTest your configuration on a managed Chromebook\nIn this section, you will test the configuration you created in Google Workspace by connecting a Chromebook to the network managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nTurn on your Chromebook and log in using your managed Google account. \nClick on the ⌔ icon in the notification area to open the Status Tray. \nClick on the ▼ icon next to the current network name in the Status Tray to show the list of available Wi-Fi networks. \nClick on the name of the network managed by Portnox Cloud to connect to it. \nThe symbol on the right side of the network SSID confirms that this network is managed by the organization.\nImportant: The first time you connect to the network may take a long time – approximately a minute. This is because Google Workspace needs to wait for the Google connector to poll the cloud and check for new SCEP requests, and the Google connector does that every 30 seconds. After the Google connector polls the cloud and finds the new request, it must connect to the Portnox Cloud SCEP server, receive a reply, and then send that reply to the Google cloud during the next poll in 30 seconds. Then, the Google Cloud must send the certificate to your Chromebook, and you can connect to the network."

This will let Portnox Cloud create Cloud accounts for new devices, and the value of this variable will be used as the name for such accounts. In this case, new Portnox accounts for new devices will be named after the device’s serial number so you can identify the devices in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Private Key Length field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Private Key Type field, select both checkboxes. \nOptional: In the SAN Type field, click on the +Add button to add a new SAN entry. Then in the left-hand side field for the new SAN entry, select the User Principal Name option, and in the right-hand side field, type {EmailAddress}. \nNote: This step is necessary for user-based certificates. If you are using device-based certificates, you can skip this step because Portnox Cloud creates device-based Portnox accounts using the value in the Subject field, not the SAN field.\nThe variable in this field must match a value from the authentication repository in Portnox Cloud, which uniquely identifies the user or the device. This is the value on the basis of which the Portnox Cloud SCEP server will know for which user or device it should issue a certificate.\nIn this example, we used the variable {EmailAddress}, which generates the UPN SAN on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn the Automatic Certificate Renewal field, we recommend that you select the ENABLED option and in the Publish Private Key field, we recommend that you select the DISABLED option. \nThese values will not directly affect the integration. They apply to your certificate renewal management and security preferences. Adjust them to your needs, if necessary.\nClick on the SAVE button to save the template. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA and the SCEP request template.\nCreate a user profile\nIn this section, you will create a user profile in Workspace ONE UEM for obtaining the SCEP certificate.\nThe user profile in Workspace ONE UEM is needed to obtain the SCEP certificate from the Portnox Cloud SCEP server for the current user or for the current device. The SCEP certificate is then used by the device profile for WiFi identification.\nIn the Profiles pane, click on the Add button and select the Add Profile option. \nIn the Add Profile pane, click on the Windows icon. \nIn the Select Device Type pane, click on the Windows Desktop icon. \nIn the Select Context pane, click on the User icon. \nIn the General tab, in the Name field, enter a name for the profile and configure other options as required by your organization policies. \nNote: In the Smart Groups field, make sure to select the correct group to push this profile to correct devices.\nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud User Profile, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the SCEP option, and then click on the Configure button in the right-hand side pane. \nIn the SCEP pane: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Defined Certificate Authority option. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP CA configuration you created earlier. \nIn the Certificate Template field, select the name of the SCEP request template you created earlier. \nIn the Key Location field, select the TPM If Present option. \nIn the bottom-right corner of the Add a New Windows Desktop Profile pane, click on the SAVE AND PUBLISH button. \nIn the View Device Assignment window, confirm if the profile will be pushed to correct devices, and then click on the PUBLISH button. \nResult: You created a user profile for Portnox Cloud and Windows devices.\nCreate a device profile\nIn this section, you will create a device profile in Workspace ONE UEM with a Wi-Fi payload for secure Wi-Fi connections.\nThe device profile in Workspace ONE UEM is used to distribute the root CA certificate that you downloaded earlier from Portnox Cloud, as well as to push the Wi-Fi configuration on the basis of the SCEP certificate generated with the help of the user profile.\nIn the left-hand side menu, select: . \nIn the Profiles pane, click on the Add button and select the Add Profile option. \nIn the Add Profile pane, click on the Windows icon. \nIn the Select Device Type pane, click on the Windows Desktop icon. \nIn the Select Context pane, click on the Device icon. \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the Credentials option, and then click on the Configure button in the right-hand side pane. \nIn the Credentials pane, configure the following payload: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Defined Certificate Authority option. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP CA configuration you created earlier. \nIn the Certificate Template field, select the name of the SCEP request template you created earlier. \nIn the Key Location field, select the TPM If Present option. \nIn the Certificate Store field, select the Personal option. \nClick on the + icon in the bottom-right corner of the Credentials pane to add another credentials payload, and then configure the following payload: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Upload option. \nIn the Certificate Store field, select the Trusted Root option. \nIn the Certificate section, click on the UPLOAD button and select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier. \nSelect the Thumbprint and use your operating system’s copy to clipboard function to copy and save the thumbprint for later, for example, in the notepad or in a text file. \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the Wi-Fi option, and then click on the Configure button in the right-hand side pane. \nIn the Wi-Fi pane: \nIn the Service Set Identifier field, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nIn the Security Type field, select the WPA2 Enterprise option. \nIn the Encryption field, select the AES option. \nIn the Protocols field, select the Certificate option. \nIn the Authentication field, select the Certificate #1 option. \nThis is the SCEP certificate that is requested by the user profile and added as the first Credentials payload in this profile.\nIn the Trusted Server Certificate Thumbprints section, click on the Add button and paste the thumbprint that you saved in the previous steps. \nThis thumbprint is needed so that the managed Windows computer recognizes the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server. Without it, the user would see a security warning.\nIn the bottom-right corner of the Add a New Windows Desktop Profile pane, click on the SAVE AND PUBLISH button. \nIn the View Device Assignment window, confirm if the profile will be pushed to correct devices, and then click on the PUBLISH button. \nResult: You created a device profile for Portnox Cloud and Windows devices.\nAfter you created your profiles, you can use your regular Workspace ONE UEM procedures to push them to managed computers immediately and see if they work correctly. For information on managing computers, pushing profiles, and troubleshooting, consult the Workspace ONE UEM documentation.\nImportant: For Windows desktops, Workspace ONE UEM does not support wired network profiles, only Wi-Fi profiles. Support for wired profiles is currently available in the Workspace ONE UEM Beta programme. Until this support is available for all Workspace ONE UEM instances, the workaround is to manually configure a device to connect to the wired LAN without Workspace ONE UEM, use the netsh command to export a lan.xml file, and then use that XML file as a custom XML payload in Workspace ONE UEM."

If Portnox Zero Trust Network Access is not the only active multi-factor authentication method, other methods such as Microsoft Authenticator will also be available.\nIn another tab of your browser, open your Microsoft Azure Portal again by accessing the following URL: https://portal.azure.com/ \nFrom now on, we will call this tab the Entra CA tab.\nNote: You can also perform these steps in the existing Entra App or Entra Auth tab but it’s more convenient to keep these tabs open in case any changes in configuration are needed after testing.\nIn the Entra ID search bar (Search resources, services, and docs), enter conditional access, and then click on the Microsoft Entra Conditional Access option below. \nIn the top menu, click on the Create new policy button. \nIn the New Conditional Access Policy pane, in the Name field, enter a name for this policy. \nThis name will only be visible in Entra ID. You can use any name you like. In this example, we used the name CAA EAM Policy.\nIn the Users section, click on the 0 users and groups selected link. On the right-hand side, in the Include and Exclude sections, select the users that are required to use multi-factor authentication. \nWarning: We strongly recommend using a limited number of users to test the configuration first, to avoid being locked out of all Entra ID access in case of an error in configuration, especially if no other multi-factor authentication methods are active. We also recommend that you have at least one emergency access account in Entra ID that does not require multi-factor authentication.\nIn the Target resources section, click on the No target resources selected link. On the right-hand side, in the Include and Exclude sections, select the applications that will require multi-faction authentication. \nIn the Grant section, click on the 0 controls selected link. In the Grant pane, select the Grant access option, and activate the Require multifactor authentication checkbox. Then, click on the Select button. \nSet the Enable policy switch to On and click on the Create button to create the conditional access policy. \nImportant: We strongly recommend that you go through your other active Entra ID Conditional Access policies and make sure they do not have conflicts with the new policy.

  "text": "Deploy the local RADIUS server container in Microsoft Azure\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local RADIUS server container in Microsoft Azure using Azure Container Instances.\nTo deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container in Azure Container Instances, you must first configure the settings for the local RADIUS server container and generate environment variables. To do it, go to the following topic: Run the local RADIUS server in a container.\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nAzure Container Instances are not the only way to deploy the local RADIUS server container in Azure but it is the easiest way. Other options include Azure Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps, and more. If you choose a different option, please follow relevant Microsoft Azure documentation to deploy your container.\nIn order for the local RADIUS server container in Azure to be able to communicate with your NAS devices in your local network, you must create a virtual network in Azure and connect it to your local network. Azure offers many ways of achieving this. This topic is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find useful information in the following Microsoft documentation topics: Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the Azure Portal and Connect an on-premises network to Azure.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local RADIUS server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nIf you have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled in Azure for your policy, you must allow Portnox Cloud services to bypass MFA by whitelisting the services’ IP addresses. To lean how to do it, see the following topic: Bypass multi-factor authentication in Entra ID.\nWe highly recommend that you create a free Docker Hub account before you begin and use the credentials of that account to pull the Docker image. This is because Docker Hub has limits on the number of anonymous pulls per IP address per hour, and without credentials, you may be unable to pull the image due to those limits being exceeded by others sharing your infrastructure’s external IPs.\nWhen you’re using stateless containers and you want to update to a newer version of the Docker image, you need to delete the container and recreate it from scratch with the same parameters.\nCreate a virtual network and subnets\nIn this section, you will create a virtual network with a subnet for local RADIUS server containers.\nYou must deploy the local RADIUS server container to a subnet that is delegated to Container Instances. This subnet cannot contain other resource types. If you already have a subnet that meets this condition, you can skip this step and choose an existing subnet instead. You can also add a subnet to an existing virtual network instead.\nOpen your Azure Portal dashboard. \nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type virtual network and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Virtual network tile, click on the Create button and select the Virtual network option from the menu. \nIn the Basics step of the Create virtual network wizard, select the Subscription, Resource group, and Region, and enter a Virtual network name that you want to use for this virtual network. Then, click on the Next button twice to skip to the IP addresses step. \nIn this example, we used the network name Containers but you can use any name you like.\nIn the IP addresses step of the Create virtual network wizard, select the IPv4 address space by entering values in the top fields, and click on the 🗑 icon in the Subnets section to delete the proposed subnet. Then, click on the Review + create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nNote: When creating subnets together with the virtual network, you cannot choose the resource type for the subnet. That’s why you should delete the proposed subnet and create subnets later.\nIn this example, we entered the address space 10.1.0.0/16 but you can use any address space you like. The default address space proposed by Azure is 10.0.0.0/16, and that’s why the subnet to be deleted on the above screenshot is from this address space.\nWhen deployment is complete, click on the Go to resource button in the notification, or go to the created virtual network from your Azure home screen. \nIn the left-hand side menu of your virtual network pane, click on the Subnets option. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Subnet button to create a new subnet. \nIn the Add subnet pane, configure the IP address range as you prefer, enter a Name for the subnet, and in the SUBNET DELEGATION section, select the Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups option. \nIn this example, we used the subnet name Containers but you can use any name you like.\nCreate a container instance\nIn this section, you will deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container to the virtual network created in the previous step.\nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type container instances and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Container Instances tile, click on the Create button and select the Container Instances option from the menu. \nIn the Container Instances pane, in the Plan field, select the Container Instances option and click on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the Create container instance wizard, select the Subscription, Resource group, and Region, and enter a Container name that you want to use for this container. \nNote: Make sure that the selected Region is the same one as the one selected for the virtual network created earlier.\nIn this example, we used the container name radius but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Image source field, select the Other registry option, in the Image type field, select the Private option, in the Image field, enter: portnox/portnox-radius, in the Image registry login server field, enter index.docker.io, and in the Image registry user name and Image registry password fields, enter your Docker Hub credentials. Then, click on the Next : Networking > button below. \nNote: If you prefer not to use a Docker Hub account, in the Image type field, choose the Public option instead, and you will not have to enter any credentials. However, you may be unable to pull the image at this time due to Docker Hub hourly anonymous pull limits.\nIn the Networking tab, in the Networking type field, select the Private option, in the Virtual network field, select the virtual network you created earlier, and in the Subnet field, select the subnet dedicated to container instances that you created earlier. Then, click on the Next : Advanced > button. \nCopy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three Key and Value pairs. In the Mark as secure column, for RADIUS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID and RADIUS_GATEWAY_PROFILE select No and for RADIUS_GATEWAY_TOKEN select Yes. Then, click on the Review + create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nAfter the deployment is complete, note down the IP address address of the server. \nResult: Your local RADIUS server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nCreate a private hosted DNS zone\nIn this section, you will create a DNS zone for your virtual network, which lets you configure your NAS devices to access the local RADIUS server using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of its IP address.\nEvery time that you stop and restart your local RADIUS server container in Azure, it may be assigned a different IP address on the subnet, which means you would have to reconfigure your NAS devices after every restart. Unfortunately, at this time, Azure does not offer any method to maintain a fixed IP address on its virtual private cloud.\nTo overcome this problem, you can configure a DNS zone in Azure, assign a private FQDN to the local RADIUS server, and configure the NAS devices to access this server using this FQDN. This way, if you need to restart the container and get a different IP address, you can just change the IP address in the zone definition instead of having to reconfigure every NAS device.\nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type dns zone and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Private DNS zone tile, click on the Create button and select the Private DNS zone option from the menu. \nIn the Basics step of the Create Private DNS zone wizard, select the Subscription and Resource group, and enter a Name that you want to use for this private DNS zone. Then, click on the Review create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nIn this example, we used the DNS zone name vorlon.private but you can use any name you like.\nAfter deployment is complete, click on the Go to resource button. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Record set button to create a new record set. \nIn the Add record set pane, in the Name field, enter the name that you want to use for your local RADIUS server host, in the Type field, select the A – Address record option, in the IP address field, enter the IP address of your deployed local RADIUS server container that you noted down in the previous task, and then click on the OK button below. \nIn this example, we used the host name radius but you can use any name you like.\nNote: If you didn’t note down the IP address earlier, open a new browser tab and check the address by going to your container instance pane in Azure and noting down the value next to the IP address (Private) field.\nIn the left-hand side menu of your private DNS zone pane, click on the Virtual network links option. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Add button to add a new virtual network link. \nIn the Add virtual network link pane, in the Link name field, enter a name for this link, in the Subscription field, select the subscription, and in the Virtual network field, select your virtual network from the list. Then, click on the OK button below. \nIn this example, we used the name radius for the link but you can use any name you like.\nResult: You can configure your NAS devices in the virtual network to access the local RADIUS server using its FQDN (in our example, radius.vorlon.private) in the virtual network instead of its IP address (in our example, 10.1.0.4). You also need to configure the resolver in the NAS device to use azureprivatedns.net as one of the DNS servers.\nIf you need to restart the container and the IP address of the local RADIUS server changes, change the IP address in the record that you created for your hosted zone."

  "text": "Deploy the local TACACS+ server container in Microsoft Azure\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local TACACS+ server container in Microsoft Azure using Azure Container Instances.\nTo deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container in Azure Container Instances, you must first configure the settings for the local TACACS+ server container and generate environment variables. To do it, go to the following topic: Run the local TACACS+ server in a container.\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nAzure Container Instances are not the only way to deploy the local TACACS+ server container in Azure but it is the easiest way. Other options include Azure Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps, and more. If you choose a different option, please follow relevant Microsoft Azure documentation to deploy your container.\nIn order for the local TACACS+ server container in Azure to be able to communicate with your NAS devices in your local network, you must create a virtual network in Azure and connect it to your local network. Azure offers many ways of achieving this. This topic is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find useful information in the following Microsoft documentation topics: Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the Azure Portal and Connect an on-premises network to Azure.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local TACACS+ server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nIf you have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled in Azure for your policy, you must allow Portnox Cloud services to bypass MFA by whitelisting the services’ IP addresses. To lean how to do it, see the following topic: Bypass multi-factor authentication in Entra ID.\nWe highly recommend that you create a free Docker Hub account before you begin and use the credentials of that account to pull the Docker image. This is because Docker Hub has limits on the number of anonymous pulls per IP address per hour, and without credentials, you may be unable to pull the image due to those limits being exceeded by others sharing your infrastructure’s external IPs.\nWhen you’re using stateless containers and you want to update to a newer version of the Docker image, you need to delete the container and recreate it from scratch with the same parameters.\nCreate a virtual network and subnets\nIn this section, you will create a virtual network with a subnet for local TACACS+ server containers.\nYou must deploy the local TACACS+ server container to a subnet that is delegated to Container Instances. This subnet cannot contain other resource types. If you already have a subnet that meets this condition, you can skip this step and choose an existing subnet instead. You can also add a subnet to an existing virtual network instead.\nOpen your Azure Portal dashboard. \nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type virtual network and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Virtual network tile, click on the Create button and select the Virtual network option from the menu. \nIn the Basics step of the Create virtual network wizard, select the Subscription, Resource group, and Region, and enter a Virtual network name that you want to use for this virtual network. Then, click on the Next button twice to skip to the IP addresses step. \nIn this example, we used the network name Containers but you can use any name you like.\nIn the IP addresses step of the Create virtual network wizard, select the IPv4 address space by entering values in the top fields, and click on the 🗑 icon in the Subnets section to delete the proposed subnet. Then, click on the Review + create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nNote: When creating subnets together with the virtual network, you cannot choose the resource type for the subnet. That’s why you should delete the proposed subnet and create subnets later.\nIn this example, we entered the address space 10.1.0.0/16 but you can use any address space you like. The default address space proposed by Azure is 10.0.0.0/16, and that’s why the subnet to be deleted on the above screenshot is from this address space.\nWhen deployment is complete, click on the Go to resource button in the notification, or go to the created virtual network from your Azure home screen. \nIn the left-hand side menu of your virtual network pane, click on the Subnets option. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Subnet button to create a new subnet. \nIn the Add subnet pane, configure the IP address range as you prefer, enter a Name for the subnet, and in the SUBNET DELEGATION section, select the Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups option. \nIn this example, we used the subnet name Containers but you can use any name you like.\nCreate a container instance\nIn this section, you will deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container to the virtual network created in the previous step.\nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type container instances and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Container Instances tile, click on the Create button and select the Container Instances option from the menu. \nIn the Container Instances pane, in the Plan field, select the Container Instances option and click on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the Create container instance wizard, select the Subscription, Resource group, and Region, and enter a Container name that you want to use for this container. \nNote: Make sure that the selected Region is the same one as the one selected for the virtual network created earlier.\nIn this example, we used the container name tacacs but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Image source field, select the Other registry option, in the Image type field, select the Private option, in the Image field, enter: portnox/portnox-tacacs, in the Image registry login server field, enter index.docker.io, and in the Image registry user name and Image registry password fields, enter your Docker Hub credentials. Then, click on the Next : Networking > button below. \nNote: If you prefer not to use a Docker Hub account, in the Image type field, choose the Public option instead, and you will not have to enter any credentials. However, you may be unable to pull the image at this time due to Docker Hub hourly anonymous pull limits.\nIn the Networking tab, in the Networking type field, select the Private option, in the Virtual network field, select the virtual network you created earlier, and in the Subnet field, select the subnet dedicated to container instances that you created earlier. Then, click on the Next : Advanced > button. \nCopy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three Key and Value pairs. In the Mark as secure column, for TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID and TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE select No and for TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN select Yes. Then, click on the Review + create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nAfter the deployment is complete, note down the IP address address of the server. \nResult: Your local TACACS+ server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nCreate a private hosted DNS zone\nIn this section, you will create a DNS zone for your virtual network, which lets you configure your NAS devices to access the local TACACS+ server using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of its IP address.\nEvery time that you stop and restart your local TACACS+ server container in Azure, it may be assigned a different IP address on the subnet, which means you would have to reconfigure your NAS devices after every restart. Unfortunately, at this time, Azure does not offer any method to maintain a fixed IP address on its virtual private cloud.\nTo overcome this problem, you can configure a DNS zone in Azure, assign a private FQDN to the local TACACS+ server, and configure the NAS devices to access this server using this FQDN. This way, if you need to restart the container and get a different IP address, you can just change the IP address in the zone definition instead of having to reconfigure every NAS device.\nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type dns zone and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Private DNS zone tile, click on the Create button and select the Private DNS zone option from the menu. \nIn the Basics step of the Create Private DNS zone wizard, select the Subscription and Resource group, and enter a Name that you want to use for this private DNS zone. Then, click on the Review create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nIn this example, we used the DNS zone name vorlon.private but you can use any name you like.\nAfter deployment is complete, click on the Go to resource button. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Record set button to create a new record set. \nIn the Add record set pane, in the Name field, enter the name that you want to use for your local TACACS+ server host, in the Type field, select the A – Address record option, in the IP address field, enter the IP address of your deployed local TACACS+ server container that you noted down in the previous task, and then click on the OK button below. \nIn this example, we used the host name tacacs but you can use any name you like.\nNote: If you didn’t note down the IP address earlier, open a new browser tab and check the address by going to your container instance pane in Azure and noting down the value next to the IP address (Private) field.\nIn the left-hand side menu of your private DNS zone pane, click on the Virtual network links option. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Add button to add a new virtual network link. \nIn the Add virtual network link pane, in the Link name field, enter a name for this link, in the Subscription field, select the subscription, and in the Virtual network field, select your virtual network from the list. Then, click on the OK button below. \nIn this example, we used the name tacacs for the link but you can use any name you like.\nResult: You can configure your NAS devices in the virtual network to access the local TACACS+ server using its FQDN (in our example, tacacs.vorlon.private) in the virtual network instead of its IP address (in our example, 10.1.0.4). You also need to configure the resolver in the NAS device to use azureprivatedns.net as one of the DNS servers.\nIf you need to restart the container and the IP address of the local TACACS+ server changes, change the IP address in the record that you created for your hosted zone."

  "text": "Guest access – Aruba\nIn this section, you will learn how to configure access points managed using Aruba Central to work together with the Portnox™ Cloud captive portal for guest user authentication.\nNote: This configuration was tested using the Aruba AP-505 Access Point.\nIn the left-hand side main menu, click on the Devices option and then, in the right-hand side pane, click on the name of the device that you want to configure. \nIn the left-hand side menu for the selected device, click on the Device option. Then, in the right-hand side pane, make sure that the WLANs tab is active, and under the Wireless SSIDs list, click on the Add SSID button to add a new SSID. \nNote: You can also edit an existing SSID by clicking on its name on the Wireless SSIDs list.\nIn the Create a New Network wizard, fill in the fields as required for your new SSID until you get to the Security step. \nIn the Security step: \nSet the Security Level slider to the Visitors position. \nIn the Type field, select the External Captive Portal option. \nClick on the + icon to the right of the Captive Portal Profile label to create a captive portal profile. \nIn the External Captive Portal – New window: \nIn the Name field, enter a name for this captive portal configuration. \nIn the IP or Hostname field, enter guests.portnox.com. \nIn the URL field, paste the value of the Captive Portal URL without the leading https://guests.portnox.com but with the leading slash. \nFor example, the URL field could look like: /b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-53d1a5eacf20-yoursuffix.\nYou can leave the default values of the remaining fields or configure them as needed. Then, click on the OK button to save your captive portal configuration. \nBack in the Create a New Network wizard’s Security step, click on the + icon to the right of the Primary Server label to create a RADIUS server configuration. \nIn the New Server window: \nIn the Server Type field, select the RADIUS option. \nIn the Name field, enter a name for this RADIUS server configuration. \nIn the IP Address/FQDN field, enter your Cloud RADIUS IP, which you obtained when you created the Cloud RADIUS server. \nIn the Shared Key and Retype Keyfields, paste your Shared Secret, also obtained when you created the Cloud RADIUS server. \nIn the Auth Port field, enter your Authentication port number, also obtained when you created the Cloud RADIUS server. \nIn the Accounting Port field, enter your Accounting port number, also obtained when you created the Cloud RADIUS server. \nIn the Timeout (in secs) field, enter 30 to avoid timeouts due to any intermittent Internet connection delays. \nClick on the OK button to save your configuration. \nOptional: Back in the Create a New Network wizard’s Security step, click on the + icon to the right of the Secondary Server label to create a second RADIUS server configuration. \nNote: Do this only if your Portnox Cloud tenant is configured with two Cloud RADIUS servers or if you’re using a local RADIUS server in addition to the Cloud RADIUS server. If you already created a secondary RADIUS server profile, for example, when configuring wireless access for employees, you can use the existing profile instead of creating a new one.\nProceed to the Access step of the Create a New Network wizard: \nSet the Access rules slider to the Role Based position. \nClick on the Add Role button below the Role table to create a new role. \nIn the Add Role window, enter a name for the new role. \nThis role will be used to control network access before the user authenticates with the captive portal, so we recommend to use a name such as Pre_Authentication.\nIn the Access rules table, in the Role column, click on the newly created role. In the Access Rules For Selected Roles column, click on the Allow any to all destinations entry. Then, click on the ✎ icon to edit the rule. \nIn the Access rules window, in the Destination field, select the To a Domain Name option, and in the Domain Name field, enter guests.portnox.com. Then, click on the OK button to save the edited rule. \nScroll all the way to the bottom of the Access rules pane, activate the checkbox next to the Assign Pre-Authentication Role field, and in the selection field, select the name of the pre-authentication role that you just created and configured. \nComplete the remaining steps of the Create a New Network wizard."

  "text": "Reactive measures: What to do if an outage happens\nWhen you configure authentication on NAS devices, you have an option to choose one of the following operational modes:\nauto: Devices that authenticate correctly using 802.1X are allowed access. Devices that fail 802.1X authentication are denied access.\nmac-based: Devices are allowed access or denied access depending on their MAC addresses.\nforce authorized: All devices are treated as authenticated (force the NAS to treat all devices as authorized).\nforce unauthorized: All devices are denied access (force the NAS to treat all devices as unauthorized).\nWhen you have an outage, you can access your NAS device and temporarily change this mode to force authorized. However, this will mean that every device that connects to the NAS will be given access. For security reasons, you may want to temporarily reconfigure your primary VLAN to not give access to any sensitive information.\nAfter the outage is over, you need to reconfigure your NAS devices back to their original settings.\nNote: This measure should be treated as a fallback measure in case everything else fails, because it requires the most work and it carries the most security risks.\nTo turn on the force authorized mode, consult your NAS device documentation. Check in your device documentation if you can do this for a template that is applied to many interfaces, which will make the process faster. We also strongly recommend to learn how to change the mode to force authorized before an outage happens."

  "text": "Onboard iOS devices with certificates using Workspace ONE UEM and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud certificates to iOS devices via Workspace ONE UEM and SCEP.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the later steps.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nYou need the root CA certificate so that your managed devices can verify the validity of Cloud RADIUS servers, which have certificates signed by this root CA certificate. If the root CA certificate is not distributed to managed devices, some devices may show a security warning each time that the user connects to networks managed by Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk to use it later. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nCreate the SCEP CA configuration and the SCEP request template\nIn this section, you will create the SCEP CA configuration and the SCEP request template in Workspace ONE UEM. This configuration and this template will be used by the profiles that you will create later.\nNote: If you already created Workspace ONE UEM profiles for other operating systems, you do not need to create a new SCEP CA configuration. However, you may need to create a new SCEP request template, if you use device-based profiles, and if the device identification for this operating system uses different authentication repository properties than other operating systems.\nOpen your Workspace ONE UEM tenant dashboard in your browser, and log in as the administrator. \nIn the Certificate Authorities pane, click on the Add button. \nIn the Certificate Authority – Add/Edit pane: \nIn the Name field, enter a name for this configuration. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Authority Type field, select the Generic SCEP option. \nIn the SCEP URL field, paste the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Static Challenge and Confirm Challenge Phrase fields, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nClick on the TEST CONNECTION button to test your configuration. \nYou should get a message Test is successful. If you get a message Test is unsuccessful, check your configuration values and also check the status of your Airwatch Cloud Connector – either make sure it is disabled, or enabled and deployed.\nClick on the SAVE AND ADD TEMPLATE button to save this configuration and proceed to adding a SCEP request template. \nIn the Certificate Template – Add/Edit pane: \nIn the Name field, type a name for this template. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP Template, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP configuration you just created. \nIn the Subject Name field, enter the variables that Workspace ONE UEM will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn this example, we used the format CN={EmailAddress}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nIf you are using device-based certificates, use a device-related value such as CN={DeviceSerialNumber} instead. This will let Portnox Cloud create Cloud accounts for new devices, and the value of this variable will be used as the name for such accounts. In this case, new Portnox accounts for new devices will be named after the device’s serial number so you can identify the devices in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Private Key Length field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Private Key Type field, select both checkboxes. \nOptional: In the SAN Type field, click on the +Add button to add a new SAN entry. Then in the left-hand side field for the new SAN entry, select the User Principal Name option, and in the right-hand side field, type {EmailAddress}. \nNote: This step is necessary for user-based certificates. If you are using device-based certificates, you can skip this step because Portnox Cloud creates device-based Portnox accounts using the value in the Subject field, not the SAN field.\nThe variable in this field must match a value from the authentication repository in Portnox Cloud, which uniquely identifies the user or the device. This is the value on the basis of which the Portnox Cloud SCEP server will know for which user or device it should issue a certificate.\nIn this example, we used the variable {EmailAddress}, which generates the UPN SAN on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn the Automatic Certificate Renewal field, we recommend that you select the ENABLED option and in the Publish Private Key field, we recommend that you select the DISABLED option. \nThese values will not directly affect the integration. They apply to your certificate renewal management and security preferences. Adjust them to your needs, if necessary.\nClick on the SAVE button to save the template. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA and the SCEP request template.\nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Workspace ONE team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Workspace ONE to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Workspace ONE, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the Base-64 encoded X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nCreate a profile for iOS\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Workspace ONE UEM for iOS devices. This profile will contain the necessary certificates as well as SCEP and Wi-Fi configurations.\nIn the Profiles pane, click on the Add button and select the Add Profile option. \nIn the Add Profile pane, click on the Apple iOS icon. \nIn the Select Context pane, click on the Device icon. \nIn the Name Your Profile field, enter a name for the profile. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud iOS Profile, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type scep, and then click on the SEARCH button. Then, click on the ADD button in the SCEP row. \nIn the SCEP section: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Defined Certificate Authority option. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP CA configuration you created earlier. \nIn the Certificate Template field, select the name of the SCEP request template you created earlier. \nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type credentials, and then click on the SEARCH button. Then, click on the ADD button in the Credentials row. \nIn the Credentials section: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Upload option. \nIn the Certificate section, click on the CHOOSE FILE button and select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier. Then, click on the ATTACH CERTIFICATE button. \nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type wi-fi, and then click on the SEARCH button. Then, click on the ADD button in the Wi-Fi row. \nIn the Wi-Fi section: \nIn the Service Set Identifier field, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nIn the Security Type field, select the WPA2 Enterprise option. \nActivate the Prevent MAC address randomization switch. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nIn the Protocols section, activate the EAP-TLS checkbox. \nIn the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates section, activate the Credentials checkbox. \nConfigure any other options as needed for your environment. \nCheck if your summary information is the same as on the screenshot, and then in the bottom-right corner of the profile pane, click on the NEXT button. \nIn the Assignment section, select the Smart Group as needed to push this profile to correct devices, configure any other options as needed in your environment, and then click on the SAVE & PUBLISH button. \nResult: You created a profile for Portnox Cloud and iOS devices.\nAfter you created your profile, you can use your regular Workspace ONE UEM procedures to push it to managed devices immediately and see if it works correctly. For information on managing devices, pushing profiles, and troubleshooting, consult the Workspace ONE UEM documentation."

  "text": "Onboard Windows devices with AgentP in unattended or kiosk mode\nIn this topic, you will learn how to run Portnox™ AgentP in unattended mode or kiosk mode.\nInstall AgentP on Windows in unattended mode\nIn this section, you will learn how to install AgentP in unattended mode. User interaction is only necessary if AgentP cannot be onboarded automatically.\nImportant: Standard AgentP unattended enrollment is only possible if the Windows device is a member of Active Directory or Entra ID, and Portnox Cloud is integrated with Active Directory or Entra ID.\nNote: To install AgentP in unattended mode, you need administrator privileges on the Windows device.\nIf you run AgentP in unattended mode, AgentP checks if the device is a member of Active Directory or Entra ID, and then sends AD/Entra ID identification data to Portnox Cloud (for example, the tenant ID, device ID, domain, user name, computer name). If the identification data matches the data in Cloud, AgentP can onboard in Portnox Cloud automatically using this data with no need of user interaction.\nDownload the AgentP installation file from the download page. \ncurl -o agentp.msi \"https://clear.portnox.com/enduser/DownloadAgentPForOsAndPackageType?osType=2&packageType=Windows_x64\"\nReplace Windows_x64 with Windows_x86 if you have a 32-bit architecture.\nRun the installation from the command prompt with a parameter for unattended installation. \nmsiexec /i agentp.msi /qn\nWhen the onboarding window appears, one of two things can happen:\nIf AgentP finds that the device/user are already onboarded, the onboarding window disappears after 5 to 20 seconds (after enrollment is complete), and AgentP is automatically enrolled.\nOtherwise, you must follow the steps in the onboarding window to enroll the current user manually. Until then, AgentP will not be enrolled.\nInstall AgentP on Windows in unattended mode with no user interaction\nIn this section, you will install AgentP in unattended mode using the logged-in Windows user. This procedure assumes that the computer was onboarded using UEM/MDM software and already has access to the secure network.\nDownload the AgentP installation file from the download page. \ncurl -o agentp.msi \"https://clear.portnox.com/enduser/DownloadAgentPForOsAndPackageType?osType=2&packageType=Windows_x64\"\nReplace Windows_x64 with Windows_x86 if you have a 32-bit architecture.\nOptional: Configure the Windows registry REG_SZ (String) values for AgentP to hide the icon from the notification area (system tray). \nCreate a .reg file with the following content. \nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP] \"TrayIcon\"=\"hide\" \nImport the .reg file that you just created. \nregedit.exe /s your_reg_file.reg\nRun the installation from the command prompt with parameters for unattended installation. \nmsiexec /i agentp.msi /qn UI_LAUNCH=1\nOptional: Check the AgentP logs to confirm that AgentP is running in unattended mode. \nThe log file will contain an entry: Running in unattended mode.\nNote: If AgentP cannot recognize the user/device as onboarded, it will show the onboarding window after it’s installed, even if you follow all the steps above. To make sure that no onboarding window is shown, ensure that your endpoint management software first onboards the user/device, and only then run AgentP installation. If the user/device is onboarded (can connect to the company network), and the onboarding window still appears, examine the AgentP logs for an underlying cause.\nInstall AgentP on Windows in unattended enrollment mode or switch to unattended enrollment mode\nIn unattended enrollment mode, AgentP runs without user interaction. If you already installed Agent in interactive mode, you can also change its configuration so that it runs in unattended mode.\nPrepare a Windows registry file with REG_SZ (String) values that make AgentP run in unattended enrollment mode. \nCreate a .reg file with the following content. \nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP] \"Mode\"=\"umode\"\nImport the .reg file that you just created. \nregedit.exe /s your_reg_file.reg\nIf you had AgentP installed before importing the settings, restart the AgentP service. \nnet stop PortnoxAgentP\nnet start PortnoxAgentP\nImportant: If AgentP is already enrolled manually, before you switch to unattended mode, you must manually unenroll it by clicking on the Deactivate button in the AgentP user interface. Otherwise, AgentP will remain enrolled with the manually onboarded user and will not automatically switch to the current Active Directory or Entra ID user.\nInstall AgentP on Windows in kiosk mode or switch to kiosk mode\nKiosk mode means that AgentP is enrolled using the computer account, not the user account. If you already have AgentP installed in default (single-user) mode, you can change its configuration so that it runs in kiosk mode.\nImportant: This mode works only with authentication repositories that support computer accounts: Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory. This mode cannot be used with Okta Workforce Identity or Google Workspace.\nConfigure the Windows registry settings for AgentP to work in kiosk mode. \nCreate a .reg file with the following REG_SZ (String) values. \nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP] \"Mode\"=\"umode\" \"Etype\"=\"computer_account\"\nImport the .reg file that you just created. \nregedit.exe /s your_reg_file.reg\nIf you had AgentP installed before importing the settings, restart the AgentP service. \nnet stop PortnoxAgentP\nnet start PortnoxAgentP\nImportant: If AgentP is already enrolled manually, before you switch to kiosk mode, you must manually unenroll it by clicking on the Deactivate button in the AgentP user interface. Otherwise, AgentP will remain enrolled with the manually onboarded user and will not automatically switch to the computer account in Active Directory or Entra ID.\nInstall AgentP on Windows in unattended mode based on SCEP certificates\nIn this section, you will learn how to install AgentP in unattended mode if your Windows is not enrolled in Entra ID or Active Directory. However, this process requires UEM software.\nThe only way to achieve unattended AgentP user enrollment on a Windows computer not enrolled in Entra ID or Active Directory is by first installing a SCEP certificate on the computer. Then, install AgentP with a specific flag (registry key), which makes it enroll based on the data in the SCEP certificate. This allows you to install AgentP in unattended mode even with other authentication repositories like Okta and Google Workspace. However, the only way to get a SCEP certificate is by using UEM software.\nInstall SCEP certificates on clients. \nCreate a suitable configuration profile in your UEM software that makes the clients request SCEP certificates from the Portnox Cloud SCEP server.\nInstall registry key values for AgentP on clients. \nThe most common way that UEM software distributes registry key values is through PowerShell scripts (see: this external example). Consult your UEM documentation to learn how to distribute Windows registry key values.\nYou need to distribute the following REG_SZ (String) values of the [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP] key:\nstring value: EnrollmentIdentity\ndata: certificate\nstring value: EnrollmentCertificate\ndata: issuer:your_organization - Portnox CLEAR, which is the CN value in the Subject of your tenant CA certificate (Example: issuer:Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR).\nNote: To check the Subject of your tenant CA certificate, open the certificate on Windows, go to the Details tab, scroll down and click on the Subject entry, and note down the value after CN = in the text box below. \nAlternatively, you can find this value in Portnox Cloud: open the Settings menu, click on the option, and in the right-hand side pane, in the table in this section, note down the value next to the Issued to label.\nDistribute AgentP to clients. \nOnce the client Windows machines have the SCEP certificate installed and the required registry key values, you can now distribute AgentP. AgentP will detect the registry key values, use them to select the correct certificate installed on the computer, and then use this certificate for unattended enrollment.\nInstall AgentP on macOS in unattended mode based on SCEP certificates\nIn this section, you will learn how to install AgentP in unattended mode on macOS. However, this process requires UEM software.\nThe only way to achieve unattended AgentP user enrollment on macOS is by first installing a SCEP certificate on the computer. Then, install AgentP with a specific configuration file, which makes it enroll based on the data in the SCEP certificate. However, the only way to get a SCEP certificate is by using UEM software.\nImportant: The SCEP certificate must have the user’s UPN or email address in the Subject or in the SAN UPN field. There are no limitations for the support of authentication repositories, all repositories that are supported by Portnox Cloud are supported in this unattended mode.\nInstall SCEP certificates on clients. \nCreate a suitable configuration profile in your UEM software that makes the clients request SCEP certificates from the Portnox Cloud SCEP server.\nInstall a configuration script on clients. \nYou need to distribute the following configuration script, which creates the unattended.cfg and uipreferences.cfg files in the /var/agentp directory before the installation of AgentP:\nmkdir -p /var/agentp json='{\"HideUI\":true}' echo $json > /var/agentp/uipreferences.cfg json='{\"Mode\":\"certificate\",\"Certificate\":\"issuer:issued_to\",\"AutoSwitch\":true,\"UseCertificateSerialNumberAsDeviceId\":true,\"profileInstallationNeeded\":false}' echo $json > /var/agentp/unattended.cfg chmod a+rw /var/agentp chmod a+rw /var/agentp/uipreferences.cfg chmod a+rw /var/agentp/unattended.cfg\nImportant: If the SCEP certificate does not have the user’s email in the Subject or in the SAN UPN, add the Domain attribute by modifying the fifth line of the above code as follows: \njson='{\"Mode\":\"certificate\",\"Certificate\":\"issuer:issued_to\",\"AutoSwitch\":true,\"UseCertificateSerialNumberAsDeviceId\":true,\"Domain\":\"your_domain\",\"profileInstallationNeeded\":false}'\nAs issued_to, paste the CN value of your tenant CA certificate: your_organization - Portnox CLEAR. \nYou can get this value by opening the certificate and checking the Subject field, or in Portnox Cloud: open the Settings menu, click on the option, and in the right-hand side pane, in the table in this section, note down the value next to the Issued to label.\nFor example: \njson='{\"Mode\":\"certificate\",\"Certificate\":\"issuer:Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR\",\"AutoSwitch\":true,\"UseCertificateSerialNumberAsDeviceId\":true,\"Domain\":\"your_domain\",\"profileInstallationNeeded\":false}'\nAs your_domain, use the domain serviced by Portnox Cloud (the domain configured in your authentication repository integration). \nFor example: \njson='{\"Mode\":\"certificate\",\"Certificate\":\"issuer:Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR\",\"AutoSwitch\":true,\"UseCertificateSerialNumberAsDeviceId\":true,\"Domain\":\"vorlon.com\",\"profileInstallationNeeded\":false}'\nDistribute AgentP to clients. \nOnce the client machines have the SCEP certificate and the configuration file, you can now distribute AgentP. AgentP will parse the configuration file, use the values from that file to select the correct SCEP certificate installed on the computer, and then use this certificate for unattended enrollment.\nExamples:\nOnboard macOS devices with AgentP using Jamf and SCEP\nOnboard macOS devices with AgentP using Intune and SCEP\nOnboard macOS devices with AgentP using Kandji"

  "text": "Configure ZTNA with on-premises resources and a Windows virtual machine\nIn this section, you will set up a ZTNA resource in Portnox Cloud and configure it to access your private resource hosted in the same local network as the Docker container.\nIn the top menu of Portnox Cloud, select the option. Then, on the Resources screen, click on the + Create resource button. \nIn the Resource type step, select the Hosted resource option, and then the Choose an existing gateway option. In the Gateway field, select the gateway that you have just created. Then, click on the Next button. \nIn the Details step, in the Resource Name field, enter the name for this resource and optionally the Resource Description. \nNote: The Resource Name must be a valid subdomain name, because the URL will be constructed using this name. You should only use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens.\nResult: If you want to use the Portnox URL, you can copy the URL for your resource by clicking on the ⧉ icon.\nNote: Make sure to check if your web resource will accept connections when accessed using this URL. If your web security solution has an anti-CSRF feature, you will need to configure it to allow this URL.\nOptional: If your resource uses the same IP address and port as other resources: \nNote: This is quite a common situation, for example, when you use a single on-premises web server to host several resources, and you create internal domain names for these resources such as: confluence.vorlon-onpremises.com or jira.vorlon-onpremises.com.\nActivate the Configure custom HTTP host header for this resource checkbox. \nIn the Value column, enter the host header value. \nOptional: If you want to use a URL in your own domain for the resource: \nActivate the Use a custom URL linked to an SSL certificate checkbox. \nIn the Upload SSL certificate section, click on the Select file button, and upload the certificate and private key for the custom URL (in the PKCS #12 format). Then, enter the password for the private key in the Certificate password field, and click on the Apply certificate button. \nNote: You must acquire the specific subdomain certificate from the relevant certificate authority, or you can use a wildcard certificate for all your subdomains.\nVerify the details displayed for the certificate. \nIf you are using a certificate with multiple domains/subdomains or a wildcard certificate, in the Domain field, select the relevant domain for your resource’s URL, and in the Suffix field (if active – only for wildcard certificates), enter the subdomain. \nIn this example, your resource URL will be: privateapp.vorlon.com.\nIn your DNS server, add a canonical name record for your resource’s URL. \nFor example, in the BIND server, enter the following record:\nprivateapp.vorlon.com. IN CNAME privateapp.us.portnox.com.\nIn the IP, port and protocol section, enter the details of the hosted resource in the IP Address, Port, and Protocol fields. \nNote: If you select HTTP in the Protocol field, to access it using ZTNA you still use HTTPS, not HTTP. For example, http://privateapp.vorlon.com or http://privateapp.us.portnox.com will not work.\nClick on the Next button. \nOptional: In the Enforcement step, change the setting to Override with custom policy and then select a risk assessment policy if you want to control access to this resource using a custom risk assessment policy. \nClick on the Add resource button to save your configuration. \nResult: Your users can now access your private resource by typing the URL in the browser."

  "text": "Create or edit a risk assessment policy\nIn this topic, you will learn how to create and assign a risk assessment policy in Portnox™ Cloud.\nTo understand what are policies in Portnox Cloud, what types of policies are available, and how they work together with accounts and groups, read the following topic: What are policies in Portnox Cloud?.\nNote: The System Default Policy is tuned to meet the requirements of most configurations. When testing or initially deploying Portnox Cloud, you can skip this topic and keep the default settings. The System Default Policy is assigned to all groups, unless you create another policy and assign it manually.\nImportant: To be able to perform risk assessment, Portnox Cloud needs an agent on the device, which provides information about this device either directly to Portnox Cloud or to an integrated UEM solution. You can use Portnox AgentP for direct integration. You can also use Microsoft Intune or Jamf integration, so that Portnox Cloud can obtain information gathered by Intune/Jamf. For devices without such risk assessment information, the risk score is automatically set to 0.\nRisk assessment policies are based on a set of attributes. You assign a value to each attribute. To learn how the final score is calculated on the basis of attributes, read the following FAQ entry: How is the risk score calculated for risk assessment policies?.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Policies option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand menu, click on the RISK ASSESSMENT POLICIES tile. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the Create new button to create a new policy. \nNote: You can also click on the ✎ icon on the right-hand side of the selected line that represents the policy to edit an existing policy, or click on the ⧉ icon to create a duplicate of one of the existing policies and edit it. The creation and editing processes are almost the same.\nIn the Risk Assessment Policy name field, enter the name for the new policy and in the Description (optional) field, enter an optional description. \nIf you’re editing the System Default Policy, you cannot change its name.\nOn the right-hand side, adjust the slider, if needed. \nThis slider controls the behavior if the device does not meet the policy. By default, if the risk score is between 0 and 69, Portnox Cloud will allow network access, and if the risk score is higher, it will generate an alert, but it will not block network access for the device. By adjusting the two handles on the slider, you can change this behavior, and, for example, configure Portnox Cloud to block the device if the risk score is above 70 and generate an alert if the risk score is over 50.\nIn the Agent-based (AgentP) section on the left-hand side, select the operating system to configure the attributes for this operating system. \nEach policy contains rules for all operating systems. If you do not configure a specific operating system, Portnox Cloud will use default settings for that operating system.\nFor detailed description of all available attributes, see the section Risk assessment policy attributes below.\nImportant: If you integrated Portnox Cloud with Microsoft Intune, there is also an Agentless (requires Intune) section on the left-hand side. This section contains attributes for all operating systems, which apply a Cloud risk score depending on the status of Intune integration and compliance. To learn more about these attributes, see the following topic: Configure risk based on the Intune integration. \nIn the right-hand side pane, configure the attributes for the selected operating system. \nRepeat the above steps for other operating systems. \nTo save your policy settings, click on the Save policy button on the bottom right of the page. \nResult: You created or edited a risk assessment policy. You can now assign this policy to groups.\nTo assign policies to groups, see the following topic: Assign policies to a group.\nRisk assessment policy attributes\nIn this section, you will learn to configure all risk assessment policy attributes for different operating systems.\nNote: Attributes are listed alphabetically. Some attributes are available for multiple operating systems. Some attributes are available only with a specific integration: Intune, Jamf, or Absolute.\nNote: In the Agentless section, there are two tabs: INTUNE and JAMF. For Windows and Android devices, only the INTUNE tab is active. For macOS and iOS devices, both tabs are active, and you should select attributes depending on whether the devices are managed by Intune or by Jamf. If they are managed by both, Intune has priority.\nAdministrator privileges\nPortnox Cloud increases the risk score if the user of the device is logged in with administrator privileges.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS\nParameters:\nRisk score\nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that the current user has logged in to the device with administrator privileges, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nAntivirus\nPortnox Cloud increases the risk score if the device does not have Portnox Cloud-supported antivirus software installed and active.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux\nParameters:\nRisk score \nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that the device has no Portnox Cloud-supported antivirus software that is active, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nGrace period \nEnter or select a value from 0 to 14400 minutes (0 = no grace period, 14400 = 10 days). If the policy attribute condition is true and the risk score is high enough to block the device, the block is delayed by the selected time. This lets the user fix the issue without losing access to the network.\nNote: If multiple policy attributes have grace periods and their conditions are true (i.e., risk is detected) with risk scores high enough to block the device, Portnox Cloud applies only the shortest of those grace periods. A grace period set for an attribute that would not cause a block does not apply, even if it is shorter than others.\nApplications\nYou can specify applications that are forbidden and applications that are required on the device. Portnox Cloud increases the risk score if if even one forbidden application is found or if even one required application is not found.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS\nParameters:\nRisk score: \nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that at least one of the forbidden applications is on the device, or that at least one of the required applications is missing, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nGrace period \nEnter or select a value from 0 to 14400 minutes (0 = no grace period, 14400 = 10 days). If the policy attribute condition is true and the risk score is high enough to block the device, the block is delayed by the selected time. This lets the user fix the issue without losing access to the network.\nNote: If multiple policy attributes have grace periods and their conditions are true (i.e., risk is detected) with risk scores high enough to block the device, Portnox Cloud applies only the shortest of those grace periods. A grace period set for an attribute that would not cause a block does not apply, even if it is shorter than others.\nFORBIDDEN APPLICATIONS \nClick on the Add an application link to add a name of an application to the forbidden list. Repeat for other applications if necessary.\nREQUIRED APPLICATIONS: \nClick on the Add an application link to add a name of an application to the required list. Repeat for other applications if necessary.\nCertificates\nYou can specify certificates that are required to be installed on the device. Portnox Cloud increases the risk score if even one required certificate is not found on the device. You can identify certificates by thumbprint or by issuer. If you enter an issuer, any certificate from that issuer will be considered valid.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS\nParameters:\nRisk score \nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that one of the specified certificates is missing, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nAdd certificate thumbprint \nClick on this link to enter a thumbprint of the required certificate. Repeat if necessary for other thumbprints.\nAdd certificate issuer \nClick on this link to enter an issuer of the required certificate. Repeat if necessary for other issuers.\nThe certificate issuer must be listed in the X.500 Directory Specification format. In Windows, you can find this information by opening a command window, typing certlm.msc to run the certificate manager, selecting a certificate, double-clicking on it, selecting the Details tab, and selecting Issuer from the list.\nFor example: CN = DigiCert Trusted Root G4, OU = www.digicert.com, O = DigiCert Inc, C = US\nNote: You can specify a list of thumbprints and a list of issuers. If Portnox Cloud finds even one certificate from the thumbprint list missing, or if it finds even one certificate from the issuer list missing, it will increase the risk score. First, Cloud checks for all thumbprints. If it finds that one or more thumbprints are missing, it searches remaining device certificates for certificates that were issued by any of the listed issuers. If it doesn’t find a matching certificate for one or more issuers, it increases the risk score.\nCrowdStrike Dormant\nYou can increase the risk score if CrowdStrike Falcon is dormant for the device.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux\nParameters:\nRisk score\nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that CrowdStrike is dormant for the device (based on information from CrowdStrike Falcon), and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nNote: CrowdStrike attributes are only available if the device has AgentP installed, or if it is managed by Intune or Jamf.\nCrowdStrike not managed\nYou can increase the risk score if the device is not managed by CrowdStrike Falcon.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux\nParameters:\nRisk score\nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that the device is not managed by CrowdStrike Falcon, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nNote: CrowdStrike attributes are only available if the device has AgentP installed, or if it is managed by Intune or Jamf.\nCrowdStrike ZTA Score\nYou can increase the risk score based on the CrowdStrike Falcon ZTA score.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux\nParameters:\nIf the CrowdStrike Falcon ZTA score is \nEnter a number from 1 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. This number represents the CrowdStrike Falcon ZTA score.\nNote: Unlike in Portnox Cloud, in CrowdStrike Falcon, the lower the ZTA number, the higher the risk.\nThen report the Portnox risk assessment score as \nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If the CrowdStrike Falcon ZTA score is lower than the number selected above, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nNote: CrowdStrike attributes are only available if the device has AgentP installed, or if it is managed by Intune or Jamf.\nDomain membership\nPortnox Cloud increases the risk score if the device is not a member of any of the listed Windows LDAP directory domains.\nOperating systems: Windows\nParameters:\nRisk score \nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu.

  "text": "Deploy the local TACACS+ server container using Docker Desktop on Windows\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local TACACS+ server container using Docker Desktop on a local Windows machine (physical or virtual).\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nWe assume that the Windows machine is already installed, configured, updated, and connected to the local network. This guide includes only the installation and configuration of Docker Desktop and the Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ server container.\nWe recommend running Portnox Docker containers using Linux for performance reasons. Portnox Docker images are built for Linux so in Windows, they have to be run using virtualization. If you run Docker Windows in a virtual machine, you will need nested virtualization, which can affect performance.\nNote: This procedure has been tested on Windows 10 Enterprise running in a Hyper-V virtual machine. It applies either unmodified or with little modifications to all other Windows versions that are still supported by Microsoft and Docker, as long as they support Hyper-V or WSL, which is required by Docker Desktop.\nInstall Docker Desktop\nIn this section, you will learn how to follow Docker documentation to install Docker Desktop on the Windows machine.\nSkip this section if Docker Desktop is already installed.\nOptional: If you want to run Docker Desktop in a virtual machine, enable nested virtualization in your hypervisor on the host machine. \nThis step depends on the hypervisor that you are using. Below are some examples for popular hypervisors. Consult the documentation of your hypervisor for more information.\nHyper-V: Execute the following command in PowerShell with administrative privileges:\nSet-VMProcessor -VMName \"vm_name\" -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true\nwhere vm_name is the name of your virtual machine.\nVirtualBox: Go to and turn on the Enable Nested VT-x/AMD-V option.\nVMware Workstation: Go to and turn on the Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI option.\nEnable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and install Ubuntu: \nNote: You can run Docker Desktop with WSL or Hyper-V. WSL is recommended for performance reasons. If you need to run Docker Desktop with Hyper-V instead, refer to the official Docker and Microsoft documentation.\nOpen Windows PowerShell with administrative privileges. \nRun the following command to enable WSL and install Ubuntu: \nResult: WSL with Ubuntu is ready and you can proceed with Docker installation.\nInstall Docker Desktop: \nDownload the Docker Desktop installer from the official website. \nRun the downloaded installer file and in the installer window, when prompted, activate the Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V checkbox. \nRestart Windows when prompted. \nRun Docker Desktop from the Start menu or the desktop icon. \nOptional: Test Docker in the Windows command line: \nOpen the Windows command line (cmd). \nRun the following command: \nResult: If you see the following output, it means your installation was successful and Docker is ready:\nRun the Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ server container\nIn this section, you will learn how to deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container locally to the Windows machine.\nOpen a command prompt with administrative privileges and run the portnox/portnox-tacacs Docker container. \ndocker run -d -p 49:49/tcp ^ --name portnox-tacacs --restart=always ^ -v portnox-tacacs-data:/data ^ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE ^ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID ^ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN ^ portnox/portnox-tacacs:latest\nwhere copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE, copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID, and copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN are the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier. You can also copy them now directly from Portnox Cloud: .\nNote: The -v option creates and mounts a Docker volume that preserves the local TACACS+ server data in case the container stops running, for example, if the machine is restarted or crashes. Without this option, local TACACS+ cached data would be lost if the container stops running. To learn more about Docker volumes and an alternative, bind mounts, see Docker documentation.\nOptional: View the logs for the portnox/portnox-tacacs Docker container. \ndocker logs portnox-tacacs -f\nResult: Your local TACACS+ server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nAutomatically update the existing local container\nIn this section, you will learn how to automatically update your Docker container to the latest version by deploying another Docker container: portnox-autoupdate.\nImportant: The portnox-autoupdate Docker container automatically updates all Portnox Docker containers to their latest versions as soon as they are available. If you already installed the portnox-autoupdate Docker container to automatically update another Portnox Docker container, you do not need to install it again.\nFind the organization ID: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to . \nIn the Self Onboarding section, see the URL that is displayed. \nNote: If self-onboarding is not activated, click on the Edit link and temporarily turn it on to see the URL.\nThe organization ID is the last part of the URL, after the last / symbol.\nFor example, if the URL is https://user-registration.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76, then the organization ID is b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nGet an API token from Portnox Cloud: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to \nClick on the Generate token link. \nIn the GENERATE A NEW TOKEN window, enter the name for the token that describes its purpose and click on the Generate token button. \nClick on the ⧉ button to copy the code and store it in a safe place. \nImportant: You will not be able to access this code again after closing this window.\nDeploy the portnox-autoupdate Docker container: \ndocker run --restart=always -d --name portnox-autoupdate ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^ -v portnox-autoupdate-logs:/app/logs ^ -e AUTO_UPDATE_ORG_ID=your_organization_ID ^ -e AUTO_UPDATE_PORTNOX_API_TOKEN=your_API_access_token ^ portnox/portnox-autoupdate:latest\nFor example:\ndocker run --restart=always -d --name portnox-autoupdate ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^ -v portnox-autoupdate-logs:/app/logs ^ -e AUTO_UPDATE_ORG_ID=b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76 ^ -e AUTO_UPDATE_PORTNOX_API_TOKEN=zZD0XR18UmNc8gG1TRt9ZyMhHnl ^ portnox/portnox-autoupdate:latest"

Older firmware versions do not support some functions, such as HTTPS redirection using a custom certificate in bridge mode.\nImportant: This guide provides general instructions for integrating Portnox Cloud with specific third-party devices. While we aim to provide helpful examples for commonly used models, configurations may vary across manufacturers, models, and environments. As a result, we cannot guarantee that these steps will work in every scenario. For questions or issues related to RADIUS setup – which is an industry standard and not specific to Portnox – or device-specific settings and troubleshooting, we recommend consulting the device manufacturer’s documentation and contacting their support team. While Portnox Support is happy to assist where possible, please note that detailed configuration of third-party devices is typically best handled by the manufacturer.\nYou can create a captive portal configuration on Fortinet controllers in one of two modes: the local bridge mode or the tunnel mode. To create a captive portal configuration:\nFirst, follow the steps to create the RADIUS server (common for both modes)\nThen, optionally configure the TLS certificate (also common for both modes)\nFinally, select the mode that fits your network configuration.\nIn the local bridge mode, the controller is only responsible for configuration management. This mode is often used in teleworking, for example, if an employee uses a company access point at home. In the tunnel mode, all the traffic from the access point is tunnelled back to the controller.\nNote: This setup was tested on a FortiGate 40F firewall and a FortiAP 233G access point.\nCreate the RADIUS server configuration\nIn this section, you will enter Portnox Cloud RADIUS server information in the Fortinet web interface and CLI.\nIn the Fortinet web interface, in the left-hand side menu, click on the option to open the list of RADIUS servers. \nAbove the SSID list, click on the Create New button. \nIn the New RADIUS Server pane, enter a Name for the RADIUS server. In the Authentication method field, select the Specify option, and then select the PAP option. \nIn the Primary Server section, paste the Cloud RADIUS IP value copied from Portnox Cloud into the IP/Name field, and paste the Shared Secret value copied from Portnox Cloud into the Secret field. Then, click on the OK button to save the configuration. \nClick on the Edit in CLI button on the right-hand side of the pane to open the CLI Console window. Then, execute the following commands: \nset radius-port Authentication port end\nwhere Authentication port is the value copied from Portnox Cloud. Then, close the CLI Console window.\nImportant: The Fortinet web interface has a major limitation. It assumes that the default port numbers for RADIUS servers are 1812 (authentication) and 1813 (accounting), and it does not let you select a custom number in the web interface. In the CLI interface, you cannot change the accounting port, and you cannot have different ports for the primary and the secondary RADIUS server. That’s why you can only use one Portnox Cloud RADIUS server in this configuration, even if you have two instances configured in Portnox Cloud.\nOptional: To test if your configuration change was successful, you can click on the RADIUS server name and then click on the Edit button to edit it, and then click on the Test Connectivity button in the Edit RADIUS Server pane. \nConfigure the TLS certificate\nOptional: In this section, you will upload and configure your own TLS certificate so you can use the captive portal in HTTPS mode.\nIf you do not complete these steps, most devices will display a warning that the captive portal is not working in a secure mode. If you want to avoid such warnings, and run the captive portal in secure mode (HTTPS):\nObtain a domain or subdomain for your captive portal\nConfigure that domain or subdomain in your DNS server\nObtain a TLS certificate for that domain or subdomain.\nTo follow the steps below, you will need:\nThe domain or subdomain name\nThe TLS certificate file for your domain or subdomain name together with the private key file (as a single PKCS#12 file or as two Base-64 encoded X.509 files)\nThe CA certificate file for the issuer of your TLS certificate in the Base-64 encoded X.509 format.\nImport the certificates: \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the option to open the list of certificates. \nNote: If the option Certificates is not visible, go to Feature Visibility and activate .\nAbove the certificate list, click on the Create/Import button, and then select the CA Certificate option. \nIn the Import CA Certificate pane, in the Type field, click on the File option, and then click on the Upload button.

If the root CA certificate is not distributed to managed devices, some devices may show a security warning each time that the user connects to networks managed by Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk to use it later. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the MaaS 360 team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure MaaS 360 to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and MaaS 360, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the Base-64 encoded X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nInstall the IBM Cloud Extender on a Windows machine\nIn this section, you will download IBM Cloud Extender and install it on a Windows virtual or physical machine. Cloud Extender is required by MaaS 360 to support the SCEP protocol.\nNote: If you previously installed Cloud Extender for your MaaS 360 tenant, you can skip this step. To configure SCEP, you can use your existing Cloud Extender installation.\nIn your browser, go to the MaaS 360 Login URL. \nYou received this URL in the initial email from MaaS 360, which IBM sent to you after you registered for MaaS 360.\nIn your MaaS 360 dashboard, in the top menu, select . \nFollow steps 2 and 3 on the screen to get your Cloud Extender license key (sent to your email) and download the Cloud Extender installer file (MaaS360_Cloud_Extender.exe). \nNote: If the Windows machine where you want to install Cloud Extender is different than the machine you are accessing the dashboard with, copy the file to the destination machine.\nRun the installer file on the destination machine and follow the installer wizard steps to install the software. \nWhen installing Cloud Extender, you will be asked to enter the license key (received via email) and your Account ID. You can find the Account ID in your MaaS 360 dashboard by clicking on the user icon in the top-right corner of the screen.\nResult: You have installed Cloud Extender on the destination Windows machine.\nCreate the SCEP CA configuration in Cloud Extender\nIn this section, you will create the SCEP CA configuration using the Cloud Extender Configuration Tool on the destination Windows machine. This configuration and this template will be used by the profiles that you will create later in the MaaS 360 tenant.\nNote: If you already created MaaS 360 UEM profiles for other operating systems, you do not need to create a new SCEP CA configuration, unless you use user-based profiles and device-based profiles for different devices, or if the device identification for this operating system uses different authentication repository properties than other operating systems.\nIn the Cloud Extender Configuration Tool, click on the Certificate Integration tile. \nIn the Certificate Integration pane, click on the Add New Template button and then select the following options: \nIn the Select your Enterprise Certificate Authority (CA) section, select the Microsoft CA option. \nIn the Select the purpose of issuing Identity Certificates section, select the option. \nClick on the Next button. \nIn the SCEP Config step: \nIn the Template Name field, enter a name for this template. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Hostname of SCEP server fields, select the http option in the first field, and in the second field, paste the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. Then, remove the http:// prefix. \nIn the SCEP Server challenge type field, select the Static option. \nIn the Challenge Value field, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nNote: The password will be displayed in clear text.\nClick on the Next button. \nIn the Cert Attributes step: \nIn the Subject field, type a variable that will help you identify this device on the Devices screen in Portnox Cloud. \nFor example: /CN=%imei%.\nPortnox Cloud will create Portnox accounts for new devices, and the value of this variable will be used as the name for such accounts. In this case, new Portnox accounts for new devices will be named after the device’s IMEI so you can identify the devices in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Subject Alternate Name field, select the None option. \nClick on the Next button. \nIn the Finish step, click on the Advanced button. \nIn the Advanced window: \nIn the SCEP Server URL field and the Challenge URL field, paste the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nAdjust the other fields according to your preferences, then click on the OK button. \nIn the Finish step: \nIn the Test Configuration section, enter example values for a user that exists in your integrated directory, and then click on the Save and Test button. \nIf the test was successful, click on the Save button to test your configuration. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA.\nCreate an iOS profile in MaaS 360\nIn this section, you will create an iOS profile in the MaaS 360 tenant for obtaining the SCEP certificate.\nIn your MaaS 360 tenant, in the top menu, select: . \nIn the Policies pane, click on the Add Policy button. \nIn the Add Policy pane: \nIn the Name field, enter the name for this policy. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud iOS, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Type field, select the iOS MDM option. \nIn the Start From field, select the My Existing Policies option. \nIn the My Existing Policies field, select the (def) Default iOS MDM Policy option. \nNote: You can also edit the Default iOS MDM Policy directly if you want all your iOS devices to use the same policy.\nIn the new policy pane, in the left-hand side menu, select the option. \nIn the Certificates pane, activate the Configure Trust or Credentials Certificates on the Device checkbox. \nIn the Trust or CA Certificates section, in the Certificate Name field, enter a name for this certificate, and then in the Certificate section, click on the + icon. \nIn this example, we used the name root certificate, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Upload New Certificate window: \nIn the Certificate Display Name field, enter a name for this certificate. \nIn this example, we used the name root certificate, but you can use any name you like.\nClick on the Drag and drop files here or click to upload link, and then select the Portnox Cloud root certificate file that you downloaded earlier. \nClick on the Save button. \nAfter you close the window, select the certificate in the Certificate field. \nIn the left-hand side menu, select the option. Then, click on the Edit button. \nIn the Wi-Fi field, select the WPA/WPA2 (Enterprise) option. \nIn the Service Set Identifier (SSID) field, type the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nActivate the Auto Join checkbox. \nActivate the Disable MAC Address Randomization checkbox. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nIn the Encryption Type field, select the WPA option. \nIn the Accepted EAP types field, select only the TLS option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates field, select the root certificate from the list. \nNote: This is the same certificate that you added earlier in the Certificates pane.\nIn the Trusted Certificate Name field, type: clear-rad.portnox.com. \nActivate the Certificate Required checkbox. \nIn the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP CA configuration that you added earlier in the Cloud Extender. \nClick on the Next button twice, and then on the Publish button to publish this policy. Then, follow the steps as requested, including confirming and entering your MaaS 360 password. \nResult: You created a profile for Portnox Cloud and iOS devices. You can now assign this profile to devices by following MaaS 360 documentation."

Also, the configuration is general and may not fit every single environment. Therefore, to get the most accurate and current configuration guidance on switch 802.1X configuration, we strongly recommend that you refer to the documentation provided by Cisco on these topics for your particular device model and OS version.\nImportant: All values in this configuration are examples. Make sure to adjust the configuration to your individual RADIUS server addresses, ports, and keys, as well as device interfaces by replacing the values presented as underlined italics.\nEnable AAA services on the device. \nCreate a new RADIUS server group. \naaa group server radius PORTNOX\nIn this configuration, we assume that you are using both Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers.\nAdd a group member to represent the US RADIUS server. \nserver name PORTNOX-CLOUD-US\nAdd a group member to represent the Europe RADIUS server. \nserver name PORTNOX-CLOUD-EMEA\nExit group member configuration. \nConfigure the switch to use the RADIUS server group for authentication. \naaa authentication dot1x default group PORTNOX\nConfigure the switch to use the RADIUS server group for authorization. \naaa authorization network default group PORTNOX\nSend new accounting information to the RADIUS server group. \naaa accounting update newinfo\nSend all session start and stop events to the RADIUS server group. \nWarning: If your switch responds with the following warning, type No and proceed to the next step: \nThis operation will permanently convert all relevant authentication commands to their CPL control-policy equivalents. As this conversion is irreversible and will disable the conversion CLI 'authentication display [legacy|new-style]', you are strongly advised to back up your current configuration before proceeding. Do you wish to continue?.\nDo not answer Yes, or you may irreversibly change your configuration; to fix it, you will have to reset your switch to factory settings.\naaa accounting identity default start-stop group PORTNOX\nSend all session stop events to the RADIUS server group even if there is no start event. \naaa accounting send stop-record always\nEnable 802.1X port-based authentication on the device. \ndot1x system-auth-control\nOptional: Enable critical EAP over LAN (EAPOL) frames, allowing them to be processed with higher priority in the authentication process. \nOptional: Specify the time interval during which critical EAP over LAN (EAPOL) frames must be received for successful recovery in case of interruption. \ndot1x critical recovery delay 2000\nOptional: Specify that the switch considers the RADIUS server as dead if no response is received within 30 seconds for four consecutive attempts. \nradius-server dead-criteria time 30 tries 4\nOptional: Set the amount of time (in minutes) during which a RADIUS server is considered unreachable or dead after a specified number of consecutive failed attempts. \nAdd your individual Portnox Cloud RADIUS server IPs and ports to the switch configuration: \nImportant: The IP addresses, port numbers, and keys below are examples. Replace them with your individual IP addresses, port numbers, and keys from your Portnox Cloud configuration.\nAdd the US Cloud RADIUS server: \nradius server PORTNOX-CLOUD-US\naddress ipv4 20.119.69.248 auth-port 10322 acct-port 10323\nkey rTHO9HEo9BcqfC9Yg0hHFelK6o0tH8N1\nexit\nAdd the Europe Cloud RADIUS server: \nradius server PORTNOX-CLOUD-EMEA\naddress ipv4 52.232.122.157 auth-port 10476 acct-port 10477\nkey fnSrSEHhXFZ5Rqpz756NJhkeVqIHTlPt\nexit\nConfigure 802.1X authentication on interface 0/1: \ninterface gigabitethernet 0/1\nNote: This is an example interface.

This lets your network administrators maintain client connectivity to certain resources without compromising security in circumstances such as an Internet connection failure.\nNote: This function may be unsupported on some switches. Consult Cisco documentation for more information about its availability for your specific model and software version.\nDefine the VLAN that will be used for critical authentication: \nIn this example, we are using VLAN 10, but you can use a different configuration.\nAssign an IP Address to the VLAN: \ninterface vlan 10 ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0\nIn this example, we are using the network 10.0.10.0/24 but you can use a different configuration.\nConfigure the g0/1 interface to use the critical auth VLAN: \ninterface gigabitethernet g0/1\nauthentication event server dead action authorize vlan 10\nIf you’re using a different VLAN, change the vlan 10 parameter.\nVerify the 802.1X configuration. \nshow dot1x all\nExpected output:\nSysauthcontrol Enabled\nDot1x Protocol Version 2\nDot1x Info for GigabitEthernet0/1\nPAE = AUTHENTICATOR\nPortControl = AUTO\nControlDirection = Both\nHostMode = SINGLE_HOST\nQuietPeriod = 60\nServerTimeout = 30\nSuppTimeout = 30\nReAuthMax = 2\nMaxReq = 2\nTxPeriod = 30\nCritical Auth VLAN = 10\nServer Dead Action = Authorize VLAN 10\nOptional: Debug the 802.1X configuration, if necessary. \ndebug mab all\ndebug dot1x all\ndebug radius\ndebug aaa authentication\ndebug aaa authorization\nHere is the entire example configuration for your convenience:\naaa new-model ! aaa group server radius PORTNOX server name PORTNOX-CLOUD-US server name PORTNOX-CLOUD-EMEA exit ! aaa authentication dot1x default group PORTNOX aaa authorization network default group PORTNOX aaa accounting update newinfo aaa accounting identity default start-stop group PORTNOX aaa accounting send stop-record always ! dot1x system-auth-control ! dot1x critical eapol dot1x critical recovery delay 2000 ! radius-server dead-criteria time 30 tries 4 radius-server deadtime 30 ! radius server PORTNOX-CLOUD-US address ipv4 20.119.69.248 auth-port 10322 acct-port 10323 key rTHO9HEo9BcqfC9Yg0hHFelK6o0tH8N1 exit ! radius server PORTNOX-CLOUD-EMEA address ipv4 52.232.122.157 auth-port 10476 acct-port 10477 key fnSrSEHhXFZ5Rqpz756NJhkeVqIHTlPt exit ! interface gigabitethernet 0/1 authentication port-control auto dot1x pae authenticator authentication host-mode single-host mab authentication order dot1x mab ! vlan 10 interface vlan 10 ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0 ! interface gigabitethernet 0/1 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan 10"

This guide includes only the installation and configuration of Docker and the Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ server container.\nNote: This procedure has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.2 and RHEL 9.3. It applies either unmodified or with little modifications to all other popular Linux distributions.\nInstall Docker\nIn this section, you will learn how to install Docker on the Linux machine.\nSkip this section if Docker is already installed.\nImportant: If you don’t have a physical or virtual machine to install Docker, you can get a third-party Linux image. For example, you can download the latest Ubuntu Server image from the Linux VM Images project and import it into your hypervisor.\nOpen the Terminal window. \nInstall Docker using your distribution’s package management framework. \nUbuntu:\nsudo apt-get install docker.io -y\nImportant: While the Ubuntu apt repository includes Docker, for production machines Docker recommends using its own apt repository instead. This gives you access to newer versions and additional packages. You can find the relevant instructions in the official Docker documentation.\nRedHat:\nsudo yum install -y yum-utils sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo sudo yum install docker-ce sudo systemctl start docker\nTest Docker using the Hello World test container. \nsudo docker run hello-world\nResult: Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\nRun the Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ server container\nIn this section, you will learn how to deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container locally to the Linux machine.\nCopy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three export commands. \nsudo export TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID sudo export TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE sudo export TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN\nRun the portnox/portnox-tacacs Docker container. \nsudo docker run -d -p 49:49/tcp \\ --name portnox-tacacs --restart=always \\ -v portnox-tacacs-data:/data \\ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE=$TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE \\ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID=$TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID \\ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=$TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN \\ portnox/portnox-tacacs:latest\nNote: The -v option creates and mounts a Docker volume that preserves the local TACACS+ server data in case the container stops running, for example, if the machine is restarted or crashes. Without this option, local TACACS+ cached data would be lost if the container stops running. To learn more about Docker volumes and an alternative, bind mounts, see Docker documentation.\nOptional: View the logs for the portnox/portnox-tacacs Docker container. \nsudo docker logs portnox-tacacs -f\nResult: Your local TACACS+ server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nAutomatically update an existing local server container\nIn this section, you will learn how to automatically update your Docker container to the latest version by deploying another Docker container: portnox-autoupdate.\nImportant: The portnox-autoupdate Docker container automatically updates all Portnox Docker containers to their latest versions as soon as they are available. If you already installed the portnox-autoupdate Docker container to automatically update another Portnox Docker container, you do not need to install it again.\nFind the organization ID: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to . \nIn the Self Onboarding section, see the URL that is displayed. \nNote: If self-onboarding is not activated, click on the Edit link and temporarily turn it on to see the URL.\nThe organization ID is the last part of the URL, after the last / symbol.\nFor example, if the URL is https://user-registration.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76, then the organization ID is b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nGet an API token from Portnox Cloud: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to \nClick on the Generate token link. \nIn the GENERATE A NEW TOKEN window, enter the name for the token that describes its purpose and click on the Generate token button. \nClick on the ⧉ button to copy the code and store it in a safe place. \nImportant: You will not be able to access this code again after closing this window.\nDeploy the portnox-autoupdate Docker container: \nsudo docker run --restart=always -d --name portnox-autoupdate \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ -v portnox-autoupdate-logs:/app/logs \\ -e AUTO_UPDATE_ORG_ID=your_organization_ID \\ -e AUTO_UPDATE_PORTNOX_API_TOKEN=your_API_access_token \\ portnox/portnox-autoupdate:latest\nFor example:\nsudo docker run --restart=always -d --name portnox-autoupdate \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ -v portnox-autoupdate-logs:/app/logs \\ -e AUTO_UPDATE_ORG_ID=b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76 \\ -e AUTO_UPDATE_PORTNOX_API_TOKEN=zZD0XR18UmNc8gG1TRt9ZyMhHnl \\ portnox/portnox-autoupdate:latest"

While we aim to provide helpful examples for commonly used models, configurations may vary across manufacturers, models, and environments. As a result, we cannot guarantee that these steps will work in every scenario. For questions or issues related to RADIUS setup – which is an industry standard and not specific to Portnox – or device-specific settings and troubleshooting, we recommend consulting the device manufacturer’s documentation and contacting their support team. While Portnox Support is happy to assist where possible, please note that detailed configuration of third-party devices is typically best handled by the manufacturer.\nWarning: This topic contains documentation prepared by our support agents more than 12 months ago. It may not cover the newest models or the newest interfaces of NAS devices. We’re working on bringing you updated documentation for NAS devices in the near future. However, the methods of setting up third-party devices may still change when the manufacturers update their firmware or release new models."

  "text": "Onboard Windows devices with user certificates using SOTI MobiControl and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud user certificates to Windows devices via SOTI MobiControl and SCEP.\nImportant: As of the moment of writing, SOTI MobiControl only supports Windows and Android devices with Portnox Cloud SCEP servers. SOTI MobiControl allows you to manage also macOS, and iOS devices, but there are issues in the SOTI MobiControl administrative interface that prevent it from working with the Portnox Cloud SCEP servers. If you need an option to manage devices other than Windows or Android, please contact SOTI for an update on when these issues will be resolved.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the later steps.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nYou need the root CA certificate so that your managed devices can verify the validity of Cloud RADIUS servers, which have certificates signed by this root CA certificate. If the root CA certificate is not distributed to managed devices, some devices may show a security warning each time that the user connects to networks managed by Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk to use it later. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nCopy the tenant CA certificate thumbprint from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will copy the tenant CA certificate thumbprint from the Cloud portal and save it, so you can use it later in SOTI MobiControl configuration.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nIn the Trusted Root Certificates section, select the value of the Thumbprint next to the certificate that you are currently using (if more than one) and use your operating system’s copy function to copy this value to the clipboard. \nSave the value from the clipboard in a temporary text file to use it later during configuration. \nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the SOTI MobiControl team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure SOTI MobiControl to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and SOTI MobiControl , here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the Base-64 encoded X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nThe thumbprint of the tenant CA certificate. For example, 6E138176256057344FEA53BDDAD3D0F6BF2D90F3.\nCreate the SCEP CA configuration and the SCEP request template\nIn this section, you will create the SCEP CA configuration and the SCEP request template in SOTI MobiControl. This configuration and this template will be used by the profiles that you will create later.\nOpen your SOTI MobiControl tenant dashboard in your browser, and log in as the administrator. \nIn the Certificate Authority window, click on the + button. \nIn the CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY window: \nIn the Name field, enter a name for this configuration. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Certificate Type field, select the ADCS option. \nIn the Configuration Type field, select the SCEP option. \nDeactivate the Use SCEP Client switch. \nIn the Service URL field, paste the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nActivate the Use Static Challenge switch. \nIn the Static Challenge field, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Thumbprint field, paste the thumbprint value that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nScroll down the CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY window to the Certificate Templates section and click on the + button. \nIn the Template Details section: \nIn the Name field, type a name for this template. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP Template, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Subject Name field, enter CN=%ENROLLEDUSER_EMAIL% (or select this value using the ⚙ icon). \nIn the Subject Alternative Names section, click on the + icon, in the ALTERNATIVE NAME TYPE column, select the User Principle Name option, and in the ALTERNATIVE NAME VALUE column, enter %ENROLLEDUSER_EMAIL% (or select this value using the ⚙ icon). \nTurn off the Provision Certificate to Authenticated Users Only switch. \nIn the Certificate Usage field, select the Signing and Encryption option. \nTurn off the Enable Non-Repudiation switch. \nIn the Key Size field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nTurn on the Remove old certificates upon successful renewal switch. \nIn the Key Protection section, select the Protected if Supported option and in the Valid Period field, keep the default value of 1 Years or change this value if desired. \nImportant: If you want to modify the default value of this field, make sure that it is the same or less than the value in Portnox Cloud: . By default, both are set to 1 year (365 days).\nIn the Hash Algorithm section, activate the SHA-1 checkbox. \nIf you are sure that all your device operating systems support newer and safer SHA-2/SHA-3 algorithms, you can also select the other checkboxes.\nIn the Extended Key Usage (EKU) section, activate the CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION switch. \nClick on the ADD button to save the template. \nClick on the SAVE button to save the SCEP configuration. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA and the SCEP request template.\nCreate a profile for Windows\nIn this section, you will create a profile in SOTI MobiControl for Windows devices.

  "text": "How are devices added to Portnox Cloud?\nIn this topic, you will learn how devices are added to Portnox™ Cloud.\nDevices are not added manually to Portnox Cloud. Instead, when the device authenticates with the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server for the first time, Portnox Cloud creates a suitable account for that device, assigns it to a group, and assigns a relevant policy.\nThe device successfully authenticates with the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server. \nOnce the device successfully authenticates, Portnox Cloud has information about the name and the domain of the device or its user, and the relevant authentication repository.\nPortnox Cloud creates a new account for the device or assigns the device to an existing account. \nIf there is no account in Portnox Cloud that corresponds to the name and the domain identifying the device or its user, Portnox Cloud creates such an account and assigns the device to this account.\nIf an account with this identifier already exists, Portnox Cloud adds the new device to the existing account.\nIf a new account was created, Portnox Cloud assigns the account to the group. \nBased on group configuration, a specific name and domain from any authentication repository can be assigned to one group, or if it is not assigned to any, the account is assigned to the Default group. At this stage, Portnox Cloud can apply all the settings relevant to the group to the new device.\nPortnox Cloud identifies and applies relevant policies. \nIn addition to privileges and/or limitations that are relevant to the group of the new device, Portnox Cloud also applies any policies that are assigned to the group, such as the risk assessment policy, the access control policy, and others."

  "text": "Certificate fragmentation issues\nIn this topic, you will learn how to address fragmentation issues when onboarding devices onto a network managed by Portnox™ Cloud using certificates.\nIf certificate-based authentication does not work but credential-based authentication works, check if the packets are being fragmented by firewalls/routers between the NAS and the RADIUS server. You can do this by obtaining a packet capture of the communication between the NAS device and the Cloud RADIUS service.\nFragmentation happens because Ethernet frames have a maximum size, called the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), which is limited to 1500 bytes. Certificates, however, are sometimes much larger than this limit. When a certificate is too big to fit within a single frame, the router or firewall will try to split it into smaller pieces, sending the data across multiple frames. Unfortunately, when the certificate is in separate pieces, the smaller fragments are often eliminated by DDoS protection mechanisms, so the server isn’t able to put them back together correctly and doesn’t recognize the certificate as valid.\nThe following are potential options to resolve such fragmentation problems:\nReduce the key size of the certificate and eliminate any unnecessary information from the certificate (for example, OCSP or CRL information). If you remove any unnecessary information from the certificate, it may be small enough to fit in a single frame.\nReduce the key size of your certificates, for example, set it to 1024. This value is configured when generating the certificate, for example, in your SCEP profiles if you use Intune, Jamf, or another UEM platform to generate your certificates, and it’s often set to be 2048 or 4096. This will also reduce the packet size, so certificates will fit in a single frame.\nUse ECC encryption to generate your certificates, not the default RSA, if possible. ECC is better, stronger, and much more efficient (requires fewer bytes) than RSA, so resultant certificates will be smaller and will be more likely to fit within a single frame even with extra information.\nUse RadSec (secure RADIUS) to communicate to Cloud RADIUS servers. RadSec is immune to frame size issues. Unfortunately, while RadSec is quite common, it may be unsupported by some NAS devices, so check manufacturer information for your model.\nInstall a local RADIUS server and use it as a proxy to the Cloud RADIUS servers. The local RADIUS server communicates with Cloud RADIUS servers using different protocols so the frame size problem does not apply – 802.1X communication happens only within your network.\nFor Palo Alto switches, try this solution.\nFor Cisco Internet SD-WAN connections, packet reassembly might cause the issue, which is resolved by issuing the following command on the interface level: no ip virtual-reassembly-out.\nFor Cisco switches also consider disabling jumbo frames.\nFor Meraki access points, consider activating the Dashboard RADIUS proxy option in the SSID configuration."

You can distribute such registry key values using Intune, too. To learn about the available values and their significance, see the following topic: AgentP configuration/installation options.\nFor each registry value that you want to add, prepare a PowerShell script to add the value. \nOpen a text editor such as Notepad and create a new text file with the following content. Replace value_name with the name of the value and value_data with the value.\nNew-Item -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP\" -Force | Out-Null; ` Set-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP\" -Name ` \"value_name\" -Value \"value_data\"\nThen, save the file as a .ps1 script.\nNote: You can add all registry values in a single script but we recommend one script per registry value. This will let you apply different values to different devices, if needed.\nIn Intune, go to the following pane: . Then, click on the Platform scripts tab, and then click on the +Add button to add a new script. \nFollow the wizard steps to add the script. You can choose any name you like for the script configuration. Then, browse for the .ps1 file that you saved and assign the script to users/devices as needed. \nResult: You created a Windows AgentP app profile in Intune and assigned it to devices."

This means that you can use the same profiles to configure other Apple devices based on these operating systems, for example, iPhones.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate\nIn this section, you will download the root CA certificate from Portnox™ Cloud, which is needed to create a profile.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nClick on any of the RADIUS servers listed in the right-hand pane to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link. \nResult: The root CA certificate file is in the Downloads folder on the local disk.\nDownload the tenant CA certificate\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud tenant CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nYou need the tenant CA certificate from Portnox Cloud so that your managed devices can verify the validity of individual SCEP certificates, which are signed using the tenant CA certificate.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Trusted Root Certificates section, click on the Download CER link, then save the downloaded file. \nThe default name of the file is Your_tenant_name - Portnox CLEAR.cer, for example, Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR.cer.\nOptional: Rename the downloaded file to tenantCertificate.cer. This is the name used in the next part of this guide. \nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Jamf team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Jamf to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Jamf, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nThe tenant CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, tenantCertificate.cer.\nCreate a Jamf configuration profile\nIn this section, you will create a configuration profile in Jamf that lets managed devices get certificates from the Portnox™ Cloud SCEP server.\nOpen your Jamf instance in the browser and log in. \nFor example, vorlon.jamfcloud.com\nIn the top-left corner, click on the Computers icon. \nIn the left-hand menu, click on the Configuration Profiles option. \nJamf shows the Configuration Profiles pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the top-right corner of the Configuration Profiles pane, click on the New button. \nJamf shows the New macOS Configuration Profile pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the General pane on the right-hand side, configure general properties for the new profile: \nIn the Name field, enter the name for this SCEP configuration profile. \nWe used the name Vorlon SCEP but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Level field, select whether this profile will be applied on the Computer Level or User Level depending on whether you will be using device certificates or user certificates. \nNote: If you use user certificates, we recommend that you select User Level in this field. However, If you prefer to use user certificates with Device Level, make sure that the Email Address field is populated correctly in the device’s inventory record in Jamf ( or ).\nIn the left-hand menu of the configuration profile pane, click on the SCEP option. \nJamf shows the Configure SCEP pane on the right-hand side.\nOn the right-hand side, click on the Configure button to configure SCEP properties for the new profile: \nIn the URL field, enter the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Redistribute Profile field, change the value Never to at least a week or more. \nNote: This value specifies when (how many days before) Jamf redistributes profiles to onboarded devices if their SCEP certificates are about to expire. Distributing a profile causes the device to request a new SCEP certificate. If this setting is left at Never, once the SCEP certificate expires, the device will lose the connection to the network and you will have to manually redistribute its profile to request a new SCEP certificate.\nIn the Subject field, enter a string to use to generate the Subject field in the user/device certificates. \nThe string can contain Jamf variables. The following are recommendations, but you should select the correct variables depending on your environment, the way you want to use AgentP, and repository:\nFor macOS user certificates, we recommend that you use: CN=$EMAIL\nFor device certificates (macOS and iOS), we recommend that you use: CN=$DEVICENAME\nThese variables are processed by Jamf and replaced by the user’s email address ($EMAIL) or Jamf device name ($DEVICENAME). Portnox Cloud then uses the values from the certificate fields to create or align with an account in Cloud.\nIf you use an incorrect variable for user certificate, Cloud will not be able to align this information with information from the authentication repository, and it will create a new Portnox account instead of aligning it with an accounts from the authentication repository.\nIf you use device certificates, Jamf will not able to create LDAP accounts, only Portnox accounts for devices. As such, the Subject value should simply contain a human-readable device name, so that it is easy to read on the Devices screen.\nFor more information about Jamf variables, see Payload Variables for Mobile Device Configuration Profiles in the Jamf Pro Administrator’s Guide.\nImportant: If you use variables, make sure that the variable value is available. For example, if you use the $USERNAME variable, make sure that there is a valid user account on the device that is also known to Jamf. If not, the device may report the following error: Unable to obtain certificate from SCEP server. Such errors are known to happen for example when devices are recycled (previously assigned to users that are no longer with the company).\nIn the Subject Alternative Name Type field, select the Uniform Resource Identifier option. In the Subject Alternative Name Value, enter https://jamfdeviceid/$UDID if you manage macOS devices or https://jamfmobiledeviceid/$UDID if you manage iOS devices, and in the NT Principal Name field, enter $EMAIL for user-based accounts or leave the field empty for device-based accounts. \nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field (NT Principal Name field in macOS). You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nIn the Challenge Type field, select Static, and in the Challenge and Verify Challenge fields, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Key Size field, select the key size that you want to use. \nIn this example, we used the value 2048 but you can use 1024 or 4096. Note that while higher values provide more security, values other than 1024 may cause certificate fragmentation problems in some network topologies. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nActivate the Use as digital signature and Use for key encipherment checkboxes. \nActivate the Allow all apps access checkbox. \nNote: This setting allows for unattended onboarding. If you do not activate this option, macOS will show a window asking for the administrator’s user name and password during onboarding.\nClick on the Upload Certificate button, then on the Choose File button, and select the tenant CA certificate file you saved earlier, then click on the Upload button. \nIn the left-hand menu of the configuration profile pane, click on the Certificate option. \nJamf shows the Configure Certificate pane on the right-hand side.\nOn the right-hand side, click on the Configure button to configure certificate properties for the new profile: \nIn the Certificate Name field, enter a display name for the root CA certificate. \nWe used the name Root CA but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Select Certificate Option field, select Upload. \nClick on the Upload Certificate button. Then, in the Certificate pop-up, click on the Choose File button, and select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier, for example, rootCertificate.cer. Then, click on the Upload button. \nClick on the + button in the top-right corner of the Certificate pane to add another certificate payload. Then, scroll down the Certificate pane to see the added section. \nIn the Certificate Name field, enter a display name for the tenant CA certificate. \nWe used the name Tenant CA but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Select Certificate Option field, select Upload. \nClick on the Upload Certificate button. Then, in the Certificate pop-up, click on the Choose File button, and select the tenant CA certificate file you saved earlier, for example, tenantCertificate.cer. Then, click on the Upload button. \nNote: You don’t have to include the tenant CA certificate in the profile. However, if you don’t distribute the tenant CA certificate to managed devices, the SCEP certificates that your devices will generate on the basis of this tenant CA will be marked in the key chain as untrusted.\nClick on the Save icon in the bottom-right corner to save the configuration profile. \nConfigure the profile for Wi-Fi\nIn this section, you will edit the configuration profile and add a Wi-Fi network configuration. This will let your managed devices access the Wi-Fi network configured in Portnox™ Cloud by using certificates obtained from the Portnox SCEP server.\nIn the top-left corner, click on the Computers icon. \nIn the left-hand menu, click on the Configuration Profiles option. \nJamf shows the Configuration Profiles pane on the right-hand side.\nFind the profile that you created earlier and click on its name. \nIn the bottom-right corner of the right-hand side pane, click on the Edit icon. \nIn the left-hand menu of the right-hand side pane, click on the Network option. \nJamf shows the Configure Network pane on the right-hand side.\nOn the right-hand side, click on the Configure button to configure network properties for the new profile: \nIn the Network Interface field, select the Wi-Fi option. \nIn the Service Set Identifier (SSID) field, enter the SSID of the Wi-Fi network that you configured in Portnox Cloud for your managed devices. \nActivate the Disable MAC Address Randomization checkbox. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nIn the Security Type field, select the WPA/WPA2 Enterprise option. \nIn the Protocols tab of the Network Security Settings section in the right-hand side pane, in the Accepted EAP Types field, activate only the TLS checkbox. \nIn the Trust tab of the Network Security Settings section in the right-hand side pane, in the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates section, click on the checkboxes next to the display names of the certificates that you uploaded earlier. \nIn the CERTIFICATE COMMON NAME section, click on the Add button and add the following name: clear-rad.portnox.com. Then, click on the Save button. \nClick on the Save icon in the bottom-right corner to save the configuration profile. \nConfigure the profile for Ethernet\nIn this section, you will edit the configuration profile and add an Ethernet network configuration. This will let your managed devices access the Ethernet network configured in Portnox™ Cloud by using certificates obtained from the Portnox SCEP server.\nIn the top-left corner, click on the Computers icon. \nIn the left-hand menu, click on the Configuration Profiles option. \nJamf shows the Configuration Profiles pane on the right-hand side.\nFind the profile that you created earlier and click on its name. \nIn the bottom-right corner of the right-hand side pane, click on the Edit icon. \nIn the left-hand menu of the right-hand side pane, click on the Network option. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the + icon in the top-right corner to create another network configuration. Then, scroll down to the newly created network configuration to set the following properties: \nIn the Network Interface field, select the Any Ethernet option. \nIn the Protocols tab of the Network Security Settings section in the right-hand side pane, in the Accepted EAP Types field, activate only the TLS checkbox. \nIn the Trust tab of the Network Security Settings section in the right-hand side pane, in the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates section, click on the checkboxes next to the display names of the certificates that you uploaded earlier. \nIn the CERTIFICATE COMMON NAME section, click on the Add button and add the following name: clear-rad.portnox.com. Then, click on the Save button. \nClick on the Save icon in the bottom-right corner to save the configuration profile. \nImportant: If you get the following error from Jamf: The SCEP server \"scep.portnox.com\" rejected the request, check the SCEP password in Portnox Cloud that you configured () and make sure it has no white spaces or any other unusual characters."

This is the value that you should use. Otherwise, Cloud will be unable to recognize the devices, and instead of mapping them to device accounts from the authentication repository, it will create new Portnox accounts for them.\nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the attributes and the values that Intune will use to fill the SAN fields of the certificate. \nImportant: In this example, we used the attribute URI with the value https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}}, which is the required value for device certificates. You can add more SAN fields if necessary.\nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Root Certificate section, click on the Root Certificate link and select the tenant CA certificate profile that you created in the earlier task. \nNote: Do not select the root CA certificate here.

By default, both are set to 1 year (365 days).\nIn the Assignments step of the wizard, use relevant options to assign this profile to specific groups or all users/devices, and then click on the Next button. \nIn the Review + create step of the wizard, review all the information, and then click on the Create button. \nResult: You created a profile for device certificates obtained through SCEP.\nCreate a profile for SCEP user certificates\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Microsoft Intune for unique user certificates, which are generated by Portnox™ Cloud for the users of devices, and obtained through SCEP requests.\nImportant: You need to complete this task only if you have macOS devices enrolled using user enrollment. If you want to use only devices enrolled using device enrollment, complete the previous task instead.\nOpen the Microsoft Intune portal in your browser: intune.microsoft.com. \nIn the Devices | Configuration pane, in the Policies tab, click on the Create button and select the New Policy option. \nIn the Create a profile pane: \nIn the Platform field, select macOS. \nIn the Profile type field, select Templates \nIn the search bar, type scep. \nIn the Template name field, click on the SCEP certificate option. \nClick on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the SCEP certificate wizard, in the Name field, type a name for this profile, optionally fill in the Description field, and click on the Next button. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP User macOS, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Configuration settings step of the SCEP certificates wizard, fill in the fields as follows, and then click on the Next button. \nAdjust the proposed values to your requirements and your environment, if needed.\nIn the Deployment Channel field, select User Channel. \nIn the Subject name format field, enter the variables that Intune will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the format CN={{UserPrincipalName}}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the user’s principal name.\nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the attributes and the values that Intune will use to fill the SAN fields of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the attribute URI with the value https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}}, and the attribute User principal name (UPN) with the value {{UserPrincipalName}}.\nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field. You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nImportant: We strongly recommend adding the URI SAN with the https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}} value, which is the device identifier. This allows Portnox Cloud to recognize situations where one device has multiple network interfaces (a Wi-Fi interface, an Ethernet interface, etc.), so that it is treated as a single device and consumes only one license. Without this attribute, agentless devices with multiple interfaces will consume separate licenses for each interface. This attribute is also used for risk assessment policies in Portnox Cloud – it lets Portnox Cloud assess the device risk and apply suitable actions.\nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Root Certificate section, click on the Root Certificate link and select the tenant CA certificate profile that you created in the earlier task. \nNote: Do not select the root CA certificate here.

This is the value that you should use. Otherwise, Cloud will be unable to recognize the devices, and instead of mapping them to device accounts from the authentication repository, it will create new Portnox accounts for them.\nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the attributes and the values that Intune will use to fill the SAN fields of the certificate. \nImportant: In this example, we used the attribute URI with the value https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}}, which is the required value for device certificates. You can add more SAN fields if necessary.\nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation.

You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nImportant: We strongly recommend adding the URI SAN with the https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}} value, which is the device identifier. This allows Portnox Cloud to recognize situations where one device has multiple network interfaces (a Wi-Fi interface, an Ethernet interface, etc.), so that it is treated as a single device and consumes only one license. Without this attribute, agentless devices with multiple interfaces will consume separate licenses for each interface. This attribute is also used for risk assessment policies in Portnox Cloud – it lets Portnox Cloud assess the device risk and apply suitable actions.\nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation.

Do not select the tenant CA certificate here. The tenant CA certificate is used in SCEP profiles to verify the validity of SCEP certificates.\nIn the Client Authentication section, in the Authentication method field, select the Certificates option. \nIn the Certificates section below, click on the Certificates link and select the profiles you created earlier: the device profile or the user profile. \nImportant: You can only select one authentication profile for the Wi-Fi network, so if you need to authenticate both user devices and dedicated devices, you need to use two different SSIDs and two Wi-Fi configurations.\nIn the Disable MAC address randomization field, select the Yes value. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nFor other fields, leave the default values or adjust values to your requirements and your environment, if needed. \nImportant: If you want to modify the default value of the Certificate validity period field, make sure that it is the same or less than the value in Portnox Cloud: . By default, both are set to 1 year (365 days).\nIn the Assignments step of the wizard, use relevant options to assign this profile to specific groups or all users/devices, and then click on the Next button. \nIn the Review + create step of the wizard, review all the information, and then click on the Create button. \nResult: You created a profile for iOS devices and the Wi-Fi network managed by Portnox Cloud."

If you want to use only user devices, complete the next task instead.\nOpen the Microsoft Intune portal in your browser: intune.microsoft.com. \nIn the Devices | Configuration pane, in the Policies tab, click on the Create button and select the New Policy option. \nIn the Create a profile pane: \nIn the Platform field, select Android Enterprise. \nIn the Profile type field, select the following, depending on whether you are creating the profile for fully managed devices or for personally-owned devices: \nor \nClick on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the SCEP certificate wizard, in the Name field, type a name for this profile, optionally fill in the Description field, and click on the Next button. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP Device Android, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Configuration settings step of the SCEP certificates wizard, fill in the fields as follows, and then click on the Next button. \nAdjust the proposed values to your requirements and your environment, if needed.\nIn the Certificate type field, select Device. \nIn the Subject name format field, enter the variables that Intune will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the format CN={{DeviceId}}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the device ID. This is the value that you should use. Otherwise, Cloud will be unable to recognize the devices, and instead of mapping them to device accounts from the authentication repository, it will create new Portnox accounts for them.\nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the attributes and the values that Intune will use to fill the SAN fields of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the attribute Email address with the value {{DeviceId}}@intunedevice.id, which is the recommended value.\nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Hash algorithm field, select SHA-1. \nIf you are sure that all your device operating systems support newer and safer SHA-2 algorithm, you can select SHA-2 instead.\nIn the Root Certificate section, click on the Root Certificate link and select the tenant CA certificate profile that you created in the earlier task. \nNote: Do not select the root CA certificate here. The root CA certificate is used in the network profile to confirm the identity of the Cloud RADIUS servers.\nIn the Extended key usage section, in the Predefined values column, select the Client Authentication option. \nIn the SCEP Server URLs section, copy and paste the SCEP URL that you saved in the first task in this series. \nFor other fields, leave the default values or adjust values to your requirements and your environment, if needed. \nImportant: If you want to modify the default value of the Certificate validity period field, make sure that it is the same or less than the value in Portnox Cloud: . By default, both are set to 1 year (365 days).\nIn the Apps step of the wizard, decide if the user must approve connections for all apps or should Android grant connection permission silently for specific apps. Then, click on the Next button. \nIn the Assignments step of the wizard, use relevant options to assign this profile to specific groups or all users/devices, and then click on the Next button. \nIn the Review + create step of the wizard, review all the information, and then click on the Create button. \nResult: You created a profile for device certificates obtained through SCEP.\nCreate a profile for SCEP user certificates\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Microsoft Intune for unique user certificates, which are generated by Portnox™ Cloud for the users of devices, and obtained through SCEP requests.\nImportant: You need to complete this task only if you want to use devices enrolled as Android Enterprise Corporate-owned user devices. If you want to use only dedicated devices, complete the previous task only.\nOpen the Microsoft Intune portal in your browser: intune.microsoft.com. \nIn the Create a profile pane: \nIn the Platform field, select Android Enterprise. \nIn the Profile type field, select the following, depending on whether you are creating the profile for fully managed devices or for personally-owned devices: \nor \nClick on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the SCEP certificate wizard, in the Name field, type a name for this profile, optionally fill in the Description field, and click on the Next button. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP User Android, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Configuration settings step of the SCEP certificates wizard, fill in the fields as follows, and then click on the Next button. \nAdjust the proposed values to your requirements and your environment, if needed.\nIn the Certificate type field, select User. \nIn the Subject name format field, enter the variables that Intune will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the format CN={{UserPrincipalName}}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the user’s principal name.\nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the attributes and the values that Intune will use to fill the SAN fields of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the attribute User principal name (UPN) with the value {{UserPrincipalName}}, and the attribute Email address with the value {{DeviceId}}@intunedevice.id.\nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field. You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation.

  "text": "How does the Portnox Cloud TACACS+ service work?\nIn this topic, you will learn how the Portnox™ Cloud TACACS+ service works.\nThe Portnox Cloud TACACS+ service is a local server. To set it up, you have two options:\nVirtual machines: You need to download a virtual machine image and its configuration, deploy it locally, and connect it to your on-premises network.\nContainers: You need to deploy a Docker container locally or in the cloud, and connect it to the on-premises network.\nThen, you need to configure your NAS devices to use this local TACACS+ server for authentication, authorization, and accounting.\nWhen a user connects to one of your NAS devices configured with TACACS+, the NAS device communicates with the local TACACS+ server.\nThe local TACACS+ server first checks user authentication by connecting to Cloud and getting authentication information from the configured authentication repository.\nIf the user is authenticated, the local TACACS+ server accesses the TACACS+ policy defined in Portnox Cloud, assigned to the user’s group.\nThe TACACS+ policy defines user authorization for services, commands, and command attributes on the NAS device. The NAS device is configured for session-based or command-based authorization. If it is configured for session-based authorization, it only requests the session to be authorized. If it is configured for command-based authorization, each command run on the NAS device needs authorization from the TACACS+ server.\nThe NAS device then reports user activity details to the TACACS+ server, and the TACACS+ server sends it to Portnox Cloud for accounting purposes. Portnox Cloud administrators can access alerts and troubleshooting logs to see user actions on the NAS devices.\nImportant: The Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ does not cache the authentication/authorization information if the Internet connection is lost, because most NAS devices that support TACACS+ have internal TACACS+ caching functionality. Please refer to the manual of your device to learn how to activate TACACS+ information caching on that device.\nNote: You can set up Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrators, but this can only be done by using Portnox AgentP as the authenticator tool."

  "text": "Deploy the local TACACS+ server container in Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local TACACS+ server container in Amazon Web Services (AWS) using AWS Fargate.\nTo deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container in AWS Container Instances, you must first configure the settings for the local TACACS+ server container and generate environment variables. To do it, go to the following topic: Run the local TACACS+ server in a container.\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nAWS Fargate is one of the options to deploy the local TACACS+ server container in AWS. Other options include using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or EC2 instances. If you choose a different option, please follow the relevant AWS documentation for your chosen method.\nIn order for the local TACACS+ server container in AWS to be able to communicate with your NAS devices in your local network, you must create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS and connect it to your local network. AWS offers many ways of achieving this. This topic is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find useful information in the following AWS documentation topic: Connect your VPC to remote networks using AWS Virtual Private Network.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local TACACS+ server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nWhen you’re using stateless containers and you want to update to a newer version of the Docker image, you need to delete the container and recreate it from scratch with the same parameters.\nCreate a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nIn this section, you will create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a private subnet for local TACACS+ server containers.\nNote: You can skip this section if you already have a Virtual Private Cloud with a subnet that you want to dedicate to your local TACACS+ server containers and relevant configuration. You can also add a new subnet to an existing VPC manually.\nIn the VPC dashboard pane, click on the Create VPC button to begin creating the VPC. \nIn the VPC settings section, select the VPC and more option. \nIn the Name tag auto-generation section, activate the Auto-generate checkbox and enter a prefix in the text field below. \nIn this example, we used the prefix portnox, but you can use any prefix you like.\nIn the IPv4 CIDR block field, enter the IPv4 CIDR block for your private network. \nIn this example, we used the 10.1.0.0/16 private network block but you can use any block you like. The default block offered by AWS is 10.0.0.0/16.\nIn the Number of Availability Zones (AZs) field, select 1. \nIn the Number of public subnets field, select 1 and in the Number of private subnets field, select 1. \nNote: You need the public subnet in AWS to connect the local TACACS+ server to the internet.\nIn the NAT gateways field, select the In 1 AZoption. \nIn the VPC endpoints field, select the None option. \nActivate the checkboxes: Enable DNS hostnames and Enable DNS resolution. \nClick on the Create VPC button below to create the VPC. \nCreate a task definition and a cluster\nIn this section, you will deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container to the Virtual Private Cloud created in the previous step by creating a task definition and a cluster.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click on the Task definitions option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create new task definition button. \nIn the Create new task definition pane, in the Task definition family field, enter a name for your task definition. \nIn this example, we used the task name TACACS but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Infrastructure requirements section, in the Launch type field, select the AWS Fargate option and in the Operating system/Architecture field, select the Linux/X86_64 option. \nIn the section, in the Name field, enter a name for the container, and in the Image URI field, enter portnox/portnox-tacacs:latest. \nIn this example, we used the container name tacacs but you can use any name you like.\nIn the section, click on the Add environment variable button three times to add three environment variables. Then, copy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three Key and Value pairs. \nOptional: If you want to store the TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN value safely as a secret, you can use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: \nIn another browser tab, in the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand menu of the Systems Manager pane, select the option. \nClick on the Create parameter button. \nIn the Create parameter pane, in the Name field, enter a name for your parameter, for example tacacs_gateway_token. \nIn the Value field, paste the value of the token copied from Portnox Cloud. \nClick on the Create parameter button below. \nGo back to the task definition tab, and in the relevant environment variable, as the value enter ssm:/tacacs_gateway_token. \nScroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Create button. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click on the Clusters option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create cluster option. \nIn the Cluster name field, enter a name for your cluster, and in the Infrastructure section, select the AWS Fargate option. Then, click on the Create button below. \nIn this example, we used the cluster Portnox but you can use any name you like.\nAfter your cluster has been created successfully, in the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click again on the Task definitions option. \nIn the Task definitions pane, click on the name of the task definition you created earlier, and then click on the latest revision in the list of revisions. \nClick on the Deploy button in the top-right corner, and select the Run task option. \nIn the Create pane, in the Existing cluster field, select the cluster that you just created. \nScroll down to the Networking section and click on the heading to show the section. In the VPC field, select the virtual private cloud that you created earlier, in the Subnets field, select the subnets that you created together with the VPC, and in the Public IP section, turn the switch off. \nScroll all the way down and click on the Create button. \nAfter the deployment is complete, note down the Private IP address of the server. \nResult: Your local TACACS+ server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nCreate a private hosted DNS zone\nIn this section, you will create a private hosted DNS zone for your Virtual Private Cloud, which lets you configure your NAS devices to access the local TACACS+ server using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of its IP address.\nEvery time that you stop and restart your local TACACS+ server container in AWS, it may be assigned a different IP address on the subnet, which means you would have to reconfigure your NAS devices after every restart. Unfortunately, at this time, AWS does not offer any method to maintain a fixed IP address on its virtual private cloud.\nTo overcome this problem, you can configure a private hosted DNS zone in AWS, assign a private FQDN to the local TACACS+ server, and configure the NAS devices to access this server using this FQDN. This way, if you need to restart the container and get a different IP address, you can just change the IP address in the zone definition instead of having to reconfigure every NAS device.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Route 53 pane, click on the Hosted zones option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create hosted zone button. \nIn the Create hosted zone pane, in the Domain name, enter the local domain name that you want to use and in the Type section, click on the Private hosted zone option. \nIn this example, we used the domain vorlon.local but you can use any domain you like.\nIn the VPCs to associate with the hosted zone section, in the Region field, select the region in which you created your VPC earlier, and in the VPC ID field, select your VPC ID from the list. \nThen, click on the Create hosted zone button below to create the hosted zone. \nIn the pane that represents your newly created hosted zone, in the Records section, click on the Create record button. \nIn the Create record pane, in the Record name field, enter the name that you want to use for your local TACACS+ server host, in the Record type field, select the A – Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources option, and in the Value field, enter the IP address of your deployed local TACACS+ server container that you noted down in the previous task. \nIn this example, we used the tacacs record name to create a tacacs.vorlon.local record but you can use any record name you like.\nNote: If you didn’t note down the IP address earlier, open a new browser tab and check the address by going to \nThen, click on the Create records button below. \nResult: You can configure your NAS devices in the VPC to access the local TACACS+ server using its FQDN (in our example, tacacs.vorlon.local) in the VPC instead of its IP address (in our example, 10.1.136.187). You also need to configure the resolver in the NAS device to use one of the AWS DNS servers listed in the NS record, in the Value field.\nIf you need to restart the container and the IP address of the local TACACS+ server changes, change the IP address in the record that you created for your hosted zone."

  "text": "Configure user browsers to automatically select the ZTNA certificate\nIn this topic, you will learn how to configure user browsers on Windows and macOS devices using UEM solutions (Microsoft Intune and Jamf) so that users are not prompted to select a certificate when accessing resources protected by Portnox™ ZTNA.\nWhen a user accesses a resource protected by Portnox ZTNA using a browser, a dialog appears prompting them to select a certificate. In some cases, the operating system may offer multiple certificates, which can make it unclear which one to choose. Even after selecting the correct certificate, the dialog may reappear the next time the browser is restarted.\nIn certain configurations, it is possible to set up user browsers to automatically select the correct certificate for ZTNA without displaying the selection dialog. This behavior has been tested and confirmed to work in the following combinations:\nIntune, Windows, and Chrome-based browsers\nIntune, macOS, and Chrome-based browsers\nJamf, macOS, and Safari\nJamf, macOS, and Chrome-based browsers\nHowever, in the following cases, we were unable to identify a method for automatic certificate selection:\nIntune, macOS, and Safari\nAny UEM, iOS, any browser\nIntune, Windows, and Chrome-based browsers\nIn this section, you will learn how to use Intune to configure Chrome-based browsers on Windows, such as Chrome or Edge, to automatically select the correct ZTNA certificate without prompting the user to make a selection.\nFind the organization ID: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to . \nIn the Self Onboarding section, see the URL that is displayed. \nNote: If self-onboarding is not activated, click on the Edit link and temporarily turn it on to see the URL.\nThe organization ID is the last part of the URL, after the last / symbol.\nFor example, if the URL is https://user-registration.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76, then the organization ID is b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nOptional: Open the Manage user certificates console on one of your users’ Windows devices. Locate a Portnox certificate under , and check the Issuer field. \nEnsure that the organization ID appears under the O (Organization) attribute.

  "text": "Preventive measures: What to do to avoid outages\nIn this topic, you will learn what preventive steps you can take to avoid disruption of your services secured by Portnox™ Cloud, if there are faults or outages.\nIf you use Portnox Cloud, your other business services such as networking or applications become dependent not just on Portnox Cloud, but also on your ISP and the connection to the Internet.\nIf you do not take any preventive measures, here is what can happen in case of temporary problems:\nIf you use Portnox Cloud to authenticate your users and devices onto your business networks, your users and devices may be unable to join networks secured by Portnox Cloud until the problem is fixed.\nIf you use Portnox Cloud for TACACS+, you may be unable to administer your network devices until the problem is fixed.\nIf you use Portnox Cloud for Zero Trust Network Access, your users may be unable to log on to your business applications until the problem is fixed.\nSuch temporary service disruptions may happen, for example, in the following circumstances:\nMost common: If there is an Internet outage, for example, if you lose connection to your ISP or if your ISP is experiencing problems.\nLess common: If there is a fault in the configuration, for example, if you delete an important file such as a certificate, or if you make a mistake when reconfiguring Portnox Cloud.\nVery rare: Due to problems with Portnox Cloud itself or the Microsoft Azure infrastructure.\nThe following are preventive measures that you can take to avoid the problems listed above:\nInstall a local RADIUS server\nThe Portnox Cloud local RADIUS server is a cache and a proxy to Portnox Cloud services. You run it on your premises, in a virtual machine or in a Docker container.\nFor the local RADIUS server to work as a preventive measure, you must configure your NAS devices to connect to the local RADIUS server as the primary server, because only then user information can be cached. If you configure your Cloud RADIUS servers as your primary servers, the local RADIUS server is not used as long as the Cloud RADIUS servers work, and so it has no cached data.\nAdvantages: \nAll your users and devices that authenticated to the network in the last 7 days will be able to authenticate for 7 days more without any connection to Cloud RADIUS servers.\nThis measure will be fully effective in case of Internet/ISP outages and Cloud/Azure outages.\nDisadvantages: \nNew users and devices, as well as those that did not authenticate in the last 7 days, will not be able to authenticate.\nThis measure will not be effective if the outage is caused by severe service disruption.\nThis measure will not be effective for Zero Trust Network Access.\nYou can install more than one local RADIUS server, for example, in different locations in your infrastructure.\nTo learn how to install and configure local RADIUS servers, see the following topics: Set up a local RADIUS server using a virtual machine and Run the local RADIUS server in a container.\nConfigure critical authentication on NAS devices\nMany modern NAS models offer functionality that is called critical auth VLAN, critical authentication, fallback VLAN, authserver timeout VLAN, auth service-unavailable VLAN, 802.1X authentication escape, or similar. All these functions mean the same thing: if for any reason your NAS device cannot reach the Portnox Cloud servers, you can decide that any current or new devices are automatically assigned to a specific VLAN, for example, to allow them access to the Internet but to keep your sensitive networks secure.\nAdvantages: \nAll your users and devices, no matter when they authenticated before, including new ones, will be assigned to the critical authentication VLAN and will be able to access services allowed by this VLAN’s configuration.\nThis measure will be fully effective in every case, including when the outage is caused by severe misconfiguration of Portnox Cloud.\nBecause the critical authentication VLAN is only accessible temporarily in the unlikely event of a service disruption, you can configure it to be the most permissive VLAN, allowing users to access all the things they might need during an outage.\nDisadvantages: \nYour users and devices will have the same access to all services permitted by the critical authentication VLAN, independent of what group these users are from, for example, both your marketing and IT departments would have the same permissions to the network.\nCritical authentication must be configured by your specialist network engineer on your equipment.\nNot all switch models and not all manufacturers offer such functionality.\nTo learn how to configure critical authentication, consult your switch documentation. We included as much information as we could in our configuration guides as well, see Configuring NAS devices for RADIUS access."

  "text": "About the monitoring mode\nIn this topic, you will learn what is the Portnox™ Cloud monitoring mode, how it works, and how to use it effectively.\nThe monitoring mode is a feature in Portnox Cloud that applies to NAS devices. You can turn it on either for a specific NAS device or for all newly connecting NAS devices. When monitoring mode is on for a specific NAS device, user devices trying to connect through that NAS will have access granted. However, if there are issues with the user device configuration, Cloud will still generate alerts to inform you of these problems. The alerts may appear as if Cloud denied access, but it actually granted it because the device is in monitoring mode.\nThink of monitoring mode as similar to having a global MAC bypass list. When a user device tries to authenticate using 802.1X and fails, Portnox Cloud checks if the device’s MAC address is on the bypass list. If it is, Cloud allows the device access to the network.\nHow to use monitoring mode\nWe recommend using monitoring mode when troubleshooting and when you can’t get user devices to connect. Since organizations often introduce Portnox Cloud directly into a production environment, even when you introduce it incrementally switch by switch, it may cause disruptions.\nHere’s how you can use monitoring mode effectively:\nStart by adding a NAS device accessed by a group of users who won’t be significantly affected if network connections temporarily fail.\nSet that NAS device to monitoring mode for a specific period, like 24 hours.\nGo to the Portnox Cloud Alerts screen and filter the alerts to show the NAS added in step 1.\nReview all displayed alerts for any issues that would prevent someone from connecting to the network.\nCorrect the issues that were discovered in the previous step.\nTurn off monitoring mode on the NAS.\nMove on to the next NAS device.\nIn urgent cases affecting the entire network, you can turn on the global monitoring mode and manually delete all NAS devices listed on the Devices screen. As soon as a user device tries to connect using any of your NAS devices, Portnox Cloud will automatically add these devices in monitoring mode, and all connections will be successful, letting you troubleshoot large-scale issues without impacting many users.\nConsiderations and warnings\nBe careful when using the global monitoring mode for extended periods, especially with Wi-Fi networks. In this mode, Portnox Cloud will let every device connect to the network, and these devices will be visible on the Devices screen. This can cause a large number of new and unknown devices, for example, if mobile phones use random MAC addresses for privacy. Additionally, anyone within your network’s range trying to connect, even if they are not part of your organization, will also be added to the Devices list and granted network access.\nA common issue with this scenario is that the number of devices increases rapidly, potentially exceeding the maximum number of devices allowed by your license. Once you exceed the license allowance, Portnox Cloud will block new devices. Devices that connected earlier, which are not essential or not associated with your organization, may cause legitimate devices to be unable to connect to the network."

  "text": "How to troubleshoot typical device onboarding issues\nIn this topic, you will learn how to address the most common issues when onboarding devices onto a network managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nIf you cannot connect your device to the network managed by Portnox Cloud, go to the Cloud portal, select Alerts in the top menu, and look at the most recent alerts. To make it easier to find relevant alerts, you can filter them by account name, NAS device, or other parameters. These alerts will inform you about the causes of authentication failures or will confirm successful authentication.\nHere are some typical reasons for connection failures:\nCheck if your group settings allow authentication with the selected method (credentials, certificates, etc.) for the network you’re trying to connect to. See the topic: Create a group.\nCheck if the account you are using is a member of the group that you have configured for the network you’re trying to connect to. See the topic: Manage members of a group.\nCheck if the number of devices per account, which is configured in group settings, has not been exceeded. For more information on setting this limit, see the topic: Edit and configure a group.\nCheck if the network in your group is set up to configure the correct authentication type. For example, if the user uses credentials and belongs to a Microsoft directory (Entra ID or AD), the group must be set up for MSCHAPv2 authentication. If the user uses credentials and belongs to a non-Microsoft directory like Google Workspace, the group must be set up for PAP authentication. If the user uses a certificate, the group must be set up for TLS authentication.\nIf you want to log in using credentials, your instance is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID, and your Entra ID access policy enforces multi-factor authentication (MFA), you need to set up a MFA bypass by following the steps in this topic: Bypass multi-factor authentication in Entra ID.\nIf you want to log in using credentials and your instance is integrated with Google Workspace, you must use an app password, not your regular password.\nIf certificate-based authentication does not work but credential-based authentication works, check if the packets are being fragmented by firewalls/routers between the NAS and the RADIUS server.\nIf you’re onboarding an Android or iOS device to a Wi-Fi network, make sure to turn off operating system features such as Use Private Address or Private Wi-Fi Address on iOS or Use randomized MAC on Android. Depending on the UEM and its configuration, and the access point and its configuration, MAC randomization may prevent network access.\nIf you’re trying to access the network without AgentP, but your account was previously activated with AgentP, check if the following setting is on: .\nIf your AgentP reports an error, see the following topic: How to collect AgentP logs for support"

  "text": "Manage members of a group\nIn this topic, you will learn how to automatically manage members of a group in Portnox™ Cloud based on groups and/or organizational units in Portnox Cloud and/or authentication repositories.\nBefore you begin, you must create a group in Portnox Cloud. To create a group and configure its basic settings, read the following topic: Create a group.\nTo understand what are groups in Portnox Cloud and how they work together with accounts and policies, read the following topic: What are groups in Portnox Cloud?.\nThere are two ways in which you can manage the relationships between accounts and groups in Portnox Cloud:\nBy assigning individual accounts to groups.\nBy mapping directory groups and/or organizational units to groups in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Groups option. \nClick on the ⋮ icon on the right-hand side of the selected group name and select the Group members option from the pop-up menu to begin the process of managing members of the selected group. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the heading that represents the repository you want to work with. \nPORTNOX REPOSITORY: Assign accounts created in Portnox Cloud to this group. If you select this option, you will be working with individual accounts, not groups. For example, contractor accounts that represent external contractors or MAC-based accounts that represent IoT devices.\nACTIVE DIRECTORY: Map Active Directory groups, accounts, and/or organizational units to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with a local AD instance (see: Integrate with Active Directory).\nENTRA ID: Map Entra ID groups, accounts, and/or organizational units to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with Entra ID (see: Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID).\nGOOGLE WORKSPACE: Map Google Workspace groups and/or accounts to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with Google Workspace (see: Integrate with Google Workspace).\nOKTA DIRECTORY: Map Okta Workforce Identity groups and/or accounts to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with Okta Workforce Identity (see: Integrate with Okta Wokforce Identity).\nOPEN LDAP: Map OpenLDAP groups, accounts, and/or organizational units to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with a local OpenLDAP instance (see: Integrate with OpenLDAP).\nNote: The list will contain only those external repositories that you integrated Portnox Cloud with.\nSelect the groups to map between the directory and this group. \nThe left pane shows directory groups available for mapping to this group. The right pane shows directory groups that are mapped to this group.\nClick on checkboxes next to group names to select them. \nYou can also start typing type name of the group in the search box on top of the pane. As you type, the list of group names shown in the panel will be restricted to only those that contain the text you are typing.\nClick on the right arrow or the left arrow symbol between panes to move selected groups between panes. \nIf you made any changes, the following buttons will appear under the panes: Reset changes and Save. Click on the Save button to save your changes or click on the Reset changes button to cancel your changes. \nOptional: Click on the Switch view option and select View OUs or View accounts to map organizational units or individual accounts between the directory and this group. \nIn addition to mapping by groups, you can also map individual user accounts or organizational units (OUs) to groups in Portnox Cloud.\nOrganizational units are available only if you selected the Use OU-based mapping option when configuring your integration, and only for Entra ID, local Active Directory, and OpenLDAP. Sub OUs are mapped along with primary OUs but in a flat structure, so we recommend using the search box to find a specific OU.\nIf you did not turn on mapping based on organizational units or your directory does not allow mapping based on organizational units, instead of the Switch view option, you will see a View accounts option to switch directly to the accounts view.\nImportant: If you select entries both from groups and organizational units, and some users are in both the selected groups and organizational units, when onboarding the user, Portnox Cloud will prioritize the authorization details of the group over those of the organizational unit. If you select individual accounts in addition to groups and/or organizational units, Cloud will prioritize individual accounts.\nRepeat the above steps for other authentication repositories if necessary. \nResult: You mapped selected directory groups and/or organizational units to this group. The first time that each user from a mapped group or organizational unit authenticates with Portnox Cloud, Cloud will make an account representing this user.\nNote: If you do not select the Allow life cycle synchronization option when setting up the integration, during synchronization Portnox Cloud will only add new users from the directory group or organizational unit and will not remove the accounts of users that are no longer in the directory group or organizational unit.\nNote: If you move users between LDAP groups, the up-to-date group members will only be visible in Portnox Cloud after you click the Force sync link on your authentication repository setup screen ()."

You can use a different port number than 10000, if needed, but then you have to modify the configuration of the insightIDR Event Source and Portnox Cloud.\nIn the virtual machine pane, in the left-hand side menu, click on the Network settings option. \nOn the right-hand side, click on the Create port rule button, and then select the Inbound port rule option from the context menu. \nIn the Add inbound security rule pane, fill in the following fields and then click on the Add button: \nIn the Source field, select IP Addresses\nIn the Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges, type 23.97.155.157, 52.168.164.222, 20.72.156.111, 51.124.144.69 (these are the Portnox Cloud IP addresses from which information is sent to SIEM software)\nIn the Destination field, select Any\nIn the Destination port ranges field, type 10000\nIn the Protocol field, select TCP\nIn the Action field, select Allow\nInstall and activate the Collector component\nIn this section, you will install the Collector component on the Linux virtual machine that you just created, and activate the Collector in insightIDR.\nIn the virtual machine pane, in the left-hand side menu, click on the Connect option. \nIn the Connect pane, select the preferred SSH connection method to connect to the virtual machine. \nNote: Since the connection method depends on your specific environment, needs, and software, the guidance on the specific method is beyond the scope of this guide. For example, you can use native SSH connection using PuTTY software on Windows and the local key downloaded while creating the virtual machine.\nLog in to your insightIDR instance and in the left-hand side menu, click on the DATA COLLECTION option. \nIn the top menu of the Data Collection Management pane, click on the Setup Collector option and from the context menu, select the Download Collector option. \nFind out the URL to download the Linux Collector to the virtual machine. \nThe URL is not directly presented by insightIDR. Here are suggestions of how to download the Collector to the virtual machine:\nSniff the URL using the Inspect mode.\nTurn on the Inspect mode in your browser. For example, in Chrome, right click on the browser window and choose the Inspect option.\nIn the inspect window, go to the Network tab. Then, click on the Download Linux Collector button.\nThe Network tab will have a new entry of the Document type called InsightSetup-Linux64.sh. Right-click on this entry and from the context menu select the option.\nThen, in your SSH window, paste the copied link into the wget command (wget copied link) to download the installation script.\nOtherwise, click on the Download Linux Collector button and then use third-party software to send the file to your virtual machine.\nIn your SSH window, type the following command: chmod +x InsightSetup-Linux64.sh to make the script executable. \nThen, type the following command: sudo ./InsightSetup-Linux64.sh to run the installer. \nFollow the steps of the installer carefully. In the last step, copy the value presented as Agent key and leave your SSH window open. \nIn your browser, go back to the Data Collection Management pane, then click on the Setup Collector option and from the context menu, select the Activate Collector option. \nNote: If the Activate Collector option is greyed out, it means that the Collector on the virtual machine did not establish a connection with insightIDR yet. Such connection may take a minute or so.\nIn the Activate collector pane, in the Collector Name field, enter a name for this collector, and in the Activation Token field, paste the Agent key value copied earlier. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox, but you can use any name you like.\nWait until the Collector is registered. This may take a few minutes. \nResult: The Collector is registered.\nConfigure an insightIDR event source for Cloud alerts\nIn this section, you will learn how to configure an Event Source in insightIDR, which will be used by the Collector to receive and parse alert information from Portnox Cloud.\nLog in to your insightIDR instance and in the left-hand side menu, click on the DATA COLLECTION option. \nIn the top menu of the Data Collection Management pane, click on the Setup Event Source option and from the context menu, select the Add Event Source option. \nIn the top menu of the Add Event Source pane, click on the Add Raw Data button and from the context menu, select the Custom Logs option. \nIn the Add Event Source pane, set up the new event source: \nIn the Name Event Source, enter a name for the new event source. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Select a Collector field, select the collector you just registered. \nIn the Collection Method section, click on the Listen on Network Port button. \nIn the Enter Port Number field, enter 10000. \nThe Linux version of the Collector requires you to use a port number higher than 1024. You can use a different port number than 10000, if needed, but then you have to modify the configuration of the virtual machine firewall and Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Protocol field, select the TCP option. \nClick on the Save button to add the new event source. \nResult: Your Event Source is active. You can see it by clicking on the DATA COLLECTION option in the left-hand side menu, and then in the top menu of the Data Collection Management pane, clicking on the Event Sources tab.\nConfigure Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will learn how to configure Portnox™ Cloud to send alert data to the Collector so that the data can be collected by Rapid7 insightIDR.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand menu, click on the option. \nCreate a new SIEM integration with insightIDR via the Collector. \nIn the SIEM integration service section, click on the Add new SIEM link. \nThe NEW SIEM INTEGRATION section opens.\nIn the Type field, select the Custom option. \nIn the Name field, enter the name for the new integration. \nIn this example, we used the name InsightIDR but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Status field, select the Enabled option. \nIn the Protocol type field, select the Syslog over TCP option. \nIn the IP field, enter the public address of your Linux virtual machine. \nIf you followed this guide from the beginning and created the virtual machine in Azure, this is the IP address that you copied earlier.\nIn the Port field, type 10000. \nThis is the port number that you opened on the virtual machine, which is the standard port number of the Sentinel connector.\nIn the Communication method field, select the Direct option. \nIn the Data format field, select the CEF option. \nClick on the Save button to add the integration. \nOptional: Test the configuration by clicking on the Test button. \nOptional: To configure the types of alerts sent to your SIEM solution, see the following topic: Portnox Cloud alerts. \nYou can also send all of the Portnox Cloud activity log (activities performed by administrators in Portnox Cloud) to your SIEM solution. To do this, go to , activate the Activity log switch, and click on the Save button.\nResult: Rapid7 insightIDR is receiving alerts from Portnox Cloud.\nYou can confirm that, for example, by running an insightIDR query."

  "text": "How to safely offboard from Portnox Cloud services\nIn this topic, you will find suggestions for safe offboarding from Portnox Cloud if you no longer want to use Cloud services and, instead, go back to an insecure network, or use a different product/service.\nWarning: Safe offboarding depends fully on how Portnox Cloud was implemented in your environment. Because only your internal network engineers and administrators know exactly how the product was configured, used, and maintained, we cannot provide definitive or exhaustive offboarding steps. You may not be using all the services or features listed here, or your setup may differ from standard practices. This list is intended solely as general guidance – it is your organization’s responsibility to evaluate and execute offboarding procedures appropriate to your unique deployment.\nEnsure that your devices can connect to networks and other services after offboarding: \nThe first and most critical step in offboarding is ensuring that your users retain access to your networks and resources. Before removing any Portnox-related components – such as integrations, certificates, virtual machines, or Docker containers – you must first confirm that all users can still connect to the networks and services that were previously secured with Portnox Cloud, or to replacement networks and services. This can be achieved either by transitioning to a replacement solution or, if necessary, by enabling access through less secure fallback configurations. Only once continuity of access is confirmed should you proceed with the removal of Portnox elements from your environment.\nIf you were using RADIUS/TACACS+, reconfigure your NAC devices. \nIf you were using Portnox Cloud RADIUS or TACACS+ services, removing Portnox configuration from your NAC devices – such as switches, access points, and VPNs – should be treated as a top priority. These devices must be reconfigured either to work with an alternative solution you plan to adopt or, if necessary, to operate in a less secure fallback mode (e.g., no port authorization on Ethernet ports, WPA2/WPA3 Personal SSIDs on access points, or local authentication and authorization for TACACS+).\nConsult your NAC device documentation to learn how to remove existing configurations and how to add new configurations for either your replacement solution or temporary less secure configurations. As a general guideline, on typical network switches you’ll want to:\nRemove any configured RADIUS or TACACS+ server entries related to Portnox Cloud.\nDisable or adjust 802.1X port-based authentication if it was enabled for Portnox Cloud.\nUpdate VLAN assignments or port security settings if they were tied to Portnox Cloud policies.\nFor wireless access points, common tasks include:\nRemoving RADIUS server settings and related authentication profiles.\nSwitching SSID security settings from Enterprise (802.1X) to Personal mode (WPA2/WPA3 Personal) if applicable.\nAdjusting certificate or client authentication settings that reference Portnox Cloud.\nSince exact steps vary by vendor and model, always refer to your specific device manuals or support resources to ensure proper configuration changes.\nIf you were using ZTNA, reconfigure all your resources/applications. \nIf you were using ZTNA for SSO-enabled web applications, each application must be reconfigured to stop relying on ZTNA for authentication. You can migrate to an alternative SSO provider, such as Entra ID or Google Workspace, or revert to using the application’s built-in login functionality. For any hosted applications that were accessed via ZTNA, external access will no longer be available once ZTNA is removed – unless you implement another remote access method, such as a VPN, to enable connectivity for remote users.\nIf you were using UEM/MDM solutions, push new profiles. \nIf you integrated Portnox with a UEM/MDM solution such as Microsoft Intune or Jamf, it’s essential to review and update any enforced configurations for client devices. These configurations must no longer direct devices to use Portnox RADIUS services, Portnox-issued certificates, or any other Portnox Cloud components. You will need to push new configurations to client devices that align with your replacement solution, or, if applicable, allow devices to connect to fallback networks using less secure methods (e.g., WPA2/WPA3 Personal SSIDs, third-party guest network, etc.).\nReconfigure your client devices. \nIf some or all of your client devices were not managed through a UEM/MDM solution, you’ll need to manually update their network configurations, including setting up network interfaces, Wi-Fi profiles, or other relevant settings to connect to your new solution or, if necessary, to less secure fallback networks such as WPA2/WPA3 Personal SSIDs. This also applies if your client device network adapters were configured using AgentP.\nRemove integrations with Portnox Cloud. \nDuring your initial onboarding with Portnox Cloud, it’s likely that you integrated it with other systems – such as authentication providers (e.g., Entra ID, Google Workspace, Okta), UEM/MDM solutions (e.g., Intune, Jamf), SIEM platforms, and others. While removing these integrations is not required for maintaining network access or service continuity, and they will cease functioning once your Portnox Cloud tenant is decommissioned, it is strongly recommended to clean them up as part of good housekeeping and to avoid unnecessary clutter or confusion in your environment.\nThe exact steps for removing these integrations will vary depending on the specific solutions involved. For example, in Azure, you should remove any Portnox-related applications from your Entra ID tenant. In SIEM platforms, you may need to delete configured log sources and any associated resources, such as virtual machines or syslog forwarders. Refer to the documentation of each integrated product to ensure all Portnox-related components are properly removed.\nRemove Portnox virtual machines, Docker containers, and LDAP Broker instances. \nYou may have virtual machines or Docker containers running Portnox-related services – such as local RADIUS, local TACACS+, ZTNA, or components used for integrations like SIEM – hosted either in your physical infrastructure or in a cloud environment. You may also have LDAP Broker services running in the background on local virtual or physical machines. Be sure to identify, stop, and remove all such instances.\nWhile these services will no longer function once your Portnox Cloud tenant is decommissioned, they may still consume resources. If they are cloud-hosted, you may continue to incur charges; if they are running locally, they will continue to occupy system resources unnecessarily.\nIf you are using cloud platforms, also remove any additional services that were provisioned specifically for Portnox Cloud – for example, in Azure, remove virtual networks, public IP addresses, log configurations, and other related infrastructure components that were created to support container instances running Portnox Docker containers.\nRemove AgentP from client devices. \nIf your devices were previously managed using AgentP, you should uninstall AgentP. While AgentP will stop functioning once your tenant is decommissioned and poses no security risk if left installed, it is recommended to uninstall it for housekeeping purposes and to free up disk space and reduce clutter.\nRemove Portnox supplicant certificates from client devices. \nIf you issued Portnox certificates to client devices – whether distributed manually, via a UEM/MDM solution through SCEP, or through self-onboarding – you can now remove them as part of housekeeping. When your Portnox Cloud tenant is decommissioned, the tenant’s Certificate Authority (CA) will no longer exist, causing all issued certificates to stop working completely. Although these certificates pose no risk if left on devices, they are unnecessary and it’s best to remove them. There is no need to revoke any supplicant certificates, since without the CA, the certificates become invalid automatically.\nRemove the Portnox tenant CA certificate from client devices, if present in the root certificates category, as it will no longer be valid or needed once the tenant is decommissioned. However, do not remove the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 certificate, the G2 certificate, or any other industry-standard CA certificates used to sign a wide range of certificates beyond Portnox. Removing these trusted root certificates may impact access to other services and cause broader connectivity or trust issues in your environment.\nDecommission your Portnox Cloud tenant. \nAs the last step, coordinate with your Portnox contact to request the decommissioning and deletion of your tenant. Keep in mind that tenant deletion is permanent – if you choose to return to Portnox Cloud in the future, you will need to create a new tenant and begin the onboarding process from the beginning."

  "text": "Security architecture and principles\nPortnox Cloud protects all data traveling from various Portnox Cloud components to and from the Portnox Cloud services, based on the following security principle: \nWith 802.1X implementation, Portnox Cloud supports only secure EAP authentication methods: TLS/TTLS and PEAP-MSCHAPv2. With potential implementation of RadSec or RADIUS proxy, any type of RADIUS communication goes inside an additional TLS-wrapped transport layer which serves as best protection from potential attacks like MITM. Portnox Cloud services use an authorization model for allowing any access, data extraction, or data submission from any Portnox Cloud or third-party components (API calls). The authorization model is based on periodically rotated API tokens that are presented by the service caller in any request. There are no anonymous calls, session management, trusted IP caches, or any other well-known techniques that jeopardize data-in-motion security; and any data submission or fetching request from Portnox Cloud components is re-authenticated and authorized anew. \nPortnox LDAP Broker\nPortnox LDAP Broker is a software application that runs on-premises on the customer network and acts as a mediator between the Portnox Cloud services and the customer’s corporate directory services (Active Directory or OpenLDAP). \nSince Active Directory users and groups are among an organization’s most valuable information, extra security measures are taken to safeguard that information: \nPortnox LDAP Broker must be installed on a Domain member server, Windows 2008 server and above (it can also be installed on the AD Domain controller).\nPortnox LDAP Broker connects to the domain controller with a domain account that has read-only access on the organizational Active Directory. \nPortnox LDAP Broker can connect to the organizational Active Directory using the LDAP or SLDAP (Secure LDAP) protocols, according to the customer’s preference.\nPortnox LDAP Broker connects to the Portnox Cloud service using outbound TCP ports 8081 and 443. Cloud traffic is always initiated by the Portnox LDAP Broker. \nPortnox LDAP Broker communicates with the Portnox Cloud services over TLS. All traffic between the Portnox LDAP Broker and the Portnox Cloud services is encrypted. \nPortnox LDAP Broker updates the Portnox Cloud service only with directory users and groups. User authentication is performed by utilizing the MS-CHAP-V2 challenge/response protocol (password doesn’t travel within the TLS encrypted tunnels, only the challenge/response hashes) or in plain text format but within the TLS encrypted tunnels (in case of enrollment or PAP RADIUS authentication attempt). \nExternal repositories\nPortnox Cloud supports several external repositories which are used to authenticate users to network and to enroll AgentP (via Portnox Cloud or federated SSO): Azure, Google Workspace, Okta.\nCommunication between Portnox Cloud, the user, and external repositories uses best security practices to provide full protection for user data:\nAll inter-service communication uses TLS tunnels so traffic between services is encrypted.\nIn case of Azure Directory Domain Services integration, Portnox LDAP Broker is installed inside the organization tenant, which provides additional security control for the organization itself. \nAll requests to the user repository are made using read-only access without any changes on customer federation provider side.\nFederated enrollment or on-boarding authentication process is fully handled by identity provider with all setup policies (like MFA). \nWireless controllers and Ethernet switches\nWireless controllers and Ethernet switches send RADIUS authentication requests to the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server, to perform validation and allow access of endpoint devices with the Portnox AgentP installed or agentless devices. The following security measurements are taken to ensure secure communication between the organizational network equipment and Portnox Cloud RADIUS in the cloud:\nAll RADIUS packets use a shared secret as key to encrypt sensitive data.\nRadSec is a new approach for RADIUS communication with the best level of security, as it works fully inside a TLS tunnel and uses the PEAP-MSCAPv2, EAP-TLS, and EAP-TTLS protocols. The TLS tunnel is used only for sensitive data, such as passwords and hashes. All common RADIUS attributes, like Calling- Station-Id, are transferred outside of the TLS tunnel. \nIn the case of MSCHAPv2, the end-user credentials never travel across networks. Instead, only the challenge/response hashes travel, enabling Portnox Cloud to reliably validate user credentials without knowing them, by using the organization’s authentication repository.\nPortnox Cloud guest management for wireless networks\nWith Portnox Cloud guest management for wireless networks, Portnox Cloud uses the built-in captive portal capabilities of each supported wireless controller vendor.\nPortnox Cloud replaces the following vendor-specific components as follows:\nReplaces the original vendor captive portal web page with the Portnox Cloud web pages\nReplaces the AAA server with the Portnox Cloud RADIUS\nReplaces the user repository with the Portnox Cloud guest management repository\nThe Portnox Cloud captive portal can be accessed only via HTTPS/SSL, unlike some vendor solutions that allow plain unencrypted HTTP access.\nGuest credentials are sent to the wireless controller using SSL. The controller then authenticates them against the Portnox Cloud RADIUS.\nWith this architecture, traffic between the wireless controller and the Portnox Cloud RADIUS could be secured by different authentication protocols, RadSec (fully inside a TLS tunnel), PEAP-MSCHAPv2, or PEAP-CHAP where only credentials are placed inside the TLS tunnel.\nVPN gateways\nPortnox Cloud can be used to authenticate VPN users using two-factor authentication, with the second factor being a strong factor. Portnox Cloud can also add an additional layer of security for users connecting remotely via VPN with the VPN gateway using the Cloud RADIUS service as an authentication authority. \nThe connection security type, tunnel encryption, and challenge/response protocol are determined exclusively by the VPN terminator itself.\nThe Portnox Cloud RADIUS service supports the highest and strongest secure connection type available today by VPN terminator vendors: the PEAP protocols family, which uses a TLS tunnel for critical data with MS-CHAP-V2 or CHAP authentication protocols inside, and even PAP, which is secured only by the RADIUS protocol level (shared secret).\nPortnox local RADIUS\nThe Portnox local RADIUS is a software application that runs on-premises on the customer network, and acts as RADIUS services to perform authentication from on-premises. It also contains cache of authentication data for the last 7 days to authenticate devices when connection to Internet cannot be established. \nPortnox Cloud local RADIUS provides the following methods to secure authentication data: \nThe Portnox Cloud local RADIUS connects to the cloud service using the outbound 443 TCP port. Cloud traffic is always initiated by the local RADIUS. \nThe Portnox Cloud local RADIUS communicates with the Portnox Cloud services over TLS. All traffic between the Portnox Cloud local RADIUS and the Portnox Cloud services is encrypted.\nCommunication between the NAS and the Portnox Cloud local RADIUS is the same as for Cloud RADIUS but happens inside on-premises network, so all data is also protected the security department of the organization."

The creation and editing processes are almost the same.\nIn the Access Control Policy Name field, enter the name for the new policy and in the field below, enter an optional description. \nIf you’re editing the System Default Policy, you cannot change its name.\nOn the left-hand side, click on the Wireless (Network) option to configure policy rules for wireless networks. \nEach policy contains rules for all three network types as well as for applications. If you do not configure a specific type, Portnox Cloud will use default settings for that type.\nIn the SUCCESSFUL AUTHENTICATION tab, define the rules for successful authentication for wireless networks: \nThese rules will apply if the device authenticates successfully with Portnox Cloud and gains access to the network.\nIn the VLAN SETTINGS section, optionally activate the Quarantine devices in a specific VLAN switch. \nIf this setting is not turned on, the device will be assigned to the default VLAN for that interface or wireless network. If this setting is turned on, you can either select a VLAN ID or VLAN name, and the NAS will assign the device to the selected VLAN.\nNote: We recommend that you use the VLAN name if the VLAN ID is inconsistent across different sites, for example, when in one office the Sales VLAN has ID 7, and in another office the Sales vlan has ID 42.\nIn the ACCESS CONTROL LIST SETTINGS section, optionally activate the Assign authenticated devices to a specific Access Control List (ACL) switch. \nIf this setting is not turned on, the device will have access to the network without being assigned to any ACLs. If this setting is turned on, you can either select an existing ACL rule ID (the rule is defined on the NAC device and simply referred to by its ID), the DACL Policy Builder to create rules one by one, or Custom DACL to paste an existing DACL that you have defined somewhere else.\nIf you selected DACL Policy Builder in the previous step, click on the Add new rule link to create a new rule. \nImportant: Only NAS devices that support dACLs (downloadable ACLs) can execute custom ACL rules. While most professional NAS devices support this technology, there are notable exceptions. Check your NAS device documentation for information about dACL support. \nPortnox Cloud supports the following vendors for downloadable ACLs:\nAruba\nBrocade\nCisco\nHP\nHuawei\nJuniper\nRuckus\nFor an example of how to create dACLs on a Cisco switch using the Policy Builder, see the following topic: Create a downloadable access control list (dACL) on a Cisco switch using the Policy Builder.\nIf you use devices that do not support dACLs, for example, Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and Wireless Service Modules (WiSMs), you need to create the ACL on the device and refer to that ACL using the ACL rule ID.\nIn the Action field, select whether this rule will Deny or Permit packets that match the rule.\nIn the Protocol field, select the protocol that this rule applies to: TCP, UDP, or Any.\nIn the Source IP or IP/Range field, enter the source IP address or the source IP address in the CIDR format or leave the field empty to match all source IP addresses.\nIn the Source port field, enter the source port number or leave the field empty to match all source port numbers.\nIn the Destination IP or IP/Range field, enter the destination IP address or the destination IP address in the CIDR format or leave the field empty to match all destination IP addresses.\nIn the Destination port field, enter the destination port number or leave the field empty to match all destination port numbers.\nClick on the Confirm button to save the rule. Add more rules using the Add new rule link (maximum 65 rules) or edit/remove existing rules using Edit or Remove links on the right-hand side of a selected rule.\nIf you selected Custom DACL in the previous step, in the Attribute name field, select the attribute name relevant to your NAS device, and in the text area below, paste your existing dACL. \nFor example:\nNote: The Custom DACL option supports up to 65 lines.\nIn the AUTHENTICATION VIOLATION tab, define the rules for authentication violation for wireless networks: \nThese rules will apply if the device fails to authenticate with Portnox Cloud for any reason.\nIn the VLAN SETTINGS section, select the action to be taken upon authentication violation: \nDeny access: The NAS will deny the device access to the network.\nQuarantine devices in a specific VLAN: The NAS will allow the device to access the network but will assign the device to a specific VLAN.\nIf you selected the Quarantine devices in a specific VLAN, follow the instructions as described for the SUCCESSFUL AUTHENTICATION tab. \nIn the RISK POLICY VIOLATION tab, define the rules for risk policy violation for wireless networks. The configuration process is identical to the one for the AUTHENTICATION VIOLATION tab. \nThese rules will apply if the device fails the assigned risk assessment policy. To create or edit a risk policy, see the following topic: Create or edit a risk assessment policy.\nIn the BLOCKED BY ADMIN tab, define the rules for when the wireless device is blocked by the administrator. The configuration process is identical to the one for the AUTHENTICATION VIOLATION tab. \nThese rules will apply if the Portnox Cloud administrator manually blocks the device on the Devices screen.\nIn the left-hand side menu, select the Wired (Network) option and repeat the steps above for wired networks. \nThe configuration options for wired networks are identical to those for wireless networks.\nIn the left-hand side menu, select the VPN (Network) option and repeat the following steps for all tabs: SUCCESSFUL AUTHENTICATION, AUTHENTICATION VIOLATION, RISK POLICY VIOLATION, and BLOCKED BY ADMIN: \nThe configuration options for VPNs are identical for all four tabs.\nClick on the Assign VPN-connected devices to a Group policy switch to activate it. \nThis setting applies to Windows Group Policies on the VPN server. If this setting is not turned on, VPN-connected devices will be assigned to the default Group Policy. If this setting is turned on, you can select the Group Policy to assign the device to.\nIn the Policy name field, enter the name of the Group Policy. \nImportant: In this context, the term group policy refers to the Cisco definition, as outlined in Cisco documentation, rather than the more popular Microsoft interpretation of group policy: A group policy is a set of user-oriented attribute/value pairs for IPSec connections that are stored either internally (locally) on the device or externally on a RADIUS server.\nIf you’re creating an access control policy for application access, select a relevant option in the RISK POLICY VIOLATION tab. \nApplication access control policies are used only by the Portnox Zero Trust Network Access functionality, and in such policies, there are no network-related settings. The policy is there only to decide the action that Zero Trust Network Access takes if the user device does not meet the risk assessment policy requirements.\nDeny access: If the user device is evaluated as unsafe by the risk assessment policy requirements, Zero Trust Network Access does not allow the user to access to the application, displaying a standard message that directs the user to Portnox documentation.\nDeny access and display message: As in the above option, but you can specify a message to display. For example, you can provide contact details for your users, or a link to your local documentation.\nDeny access and redirect user to a given URL: As in the first option, but you can automatically redirect the user to any URL, for example, your local documentation pages for troubleshooting or contact information.\nAlways allow access: This setting is only recommended for testing in a monitoring mode. Zero Trust Network Access will allow the user to access the application even if the device is evaluated as unsafe by the risk assessment policy.\nThe Advanced settings section lets you choose between two options of how to handle the situation when the user ID presented in the certificate does not match the user ID in the identity provider:\nDeny access: We recommend using this option for enhanced security. If there is a user mismatch between the identity provider and the certificate, the user will be denied access. This is the default setting.\nAllow access: Use this option only if you use shared accounts, which we do not recommend for security reasons.\nTo save your policy settings, click on the Save button on the bottom right of the page. \nResult: You created or edited an access control policy. You can now assign this policy to groups.\nTo assign policies to groups, see the following topic: Assign policies to a group.\nImportant: If you change the VLAN/ACL assignments of a policy that is already used by devices, these changes do not apply immediately, but only after the device disconnects and reconnects to the network. This is because only then the device will receive the new assignments from the RADIUS server. However, you can force such a disconnect by using the RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA) feature. To learn more about how to set up your environment to support RADIUS CoA, see the following topic: Enable the RADIUS Change of Authorization feature."

  "text": "Create a downloadable access control list (dACL) on a Cisco switch using the Policy Builder\nIn this topic, you will learn how to create downloadable access lists (dACLs) on Cisco switches using the Portnox™ Cloud dACL Policy Builder.\nNote: Portnox Cloud supports downloadable ACLs for most NAS devices from most popular manufacturers, not only Cisco.\nImportant: Portnox Cloud lets you create downloadable ACLs using either the DACL Policy Builder, as described here, or as a Custom dACL, where you can simply copy and paste your existing downloadable ACL that you have defined somewhere else.\nWarning: We tested this configuration on several models and several versions of Cisco switches but we cannot guarantee that it will cover every Cisco model. Therefore, to get the most accurate and current configuration guidance on dACL configuration, we strongly recommend that you refer to the documentation provided by Cisco on these topics for your particular device model.\nEnable IP device tracking. \nTo use dACLs on a Cisco switch, you must enable IP device tracking. This allows the switch to populate a source IP address (or destination dACL for return traffic) in the dACL. Without IP device tracking enabled, downloadable ACL assignment will not work.\nFor IOS version ≤ 15.0: IP device tracking is disabled by default.\nFor IOS version = 15.1: We could not find information regarding this version. We recommend entering the command to enable IP device tracking as a precaution.\nFor IOS version ≥ 15.2 with dot1x enabled, IP device tracking is enabled by default.\nEnter the following AAA commands in config mode. These commands are required for dACL assignment to work. \nradius-server vsa send authentication radius-server vsa send accounting aaa authorization network default group radius local\nConfigure the custom dACL in Portnox Cloud. \nImportant:\nThe source IP address must always be set to ANY (when configuring in Portnox Cloud, just leave it empty to set it to ANY). Cisco uses IP device tracking to auto-populate the source address and port in the dACL.\nThe first dACL rules must be set up to allow for DHCP traffic to be exchanged. This can be done by adding both DHCP UDP (68) and BootP UDP (67) ports. DHCP requests initiate on UDP port 67 but are changed by the DHCP server to UDP port 68 when responding. Without both these lines, a DHCP request will not be successful.\nThe last line of the dACL must be a DENY ALL or PERMIT ALL. Most likely this will be a DENY ALL.\nThe following is an example dACL restricting an authenticated device to two subnets. The subnets are 10.1.0.0/16 and 10.16.1.0/24.\nVerify and troubleshoot. \nYou can use the following commands to verify that the dACL has been assigned. Critical data is highlighted.\nShow interface details. \nshow authentications session interface interface_name details\nFor example:\nshow authentication sessions gigabitEthernet 1/0/10 details Interface: GigabitEthernet1/0/10 MAC Address: 3c18.a00c.484c IPv6 Address: Unknown IPv4 Address: 10.2.64.91 User-Name: kosh@vorlon.com Status: Authorized Domain: DATA Oper host mode: multi-domain Oper control dir: both Session timeout: N/A Restart timeout: N/A Periodic Acct timeout: N/A Session Uptime: 22s Common Session ID: 0A02190B000000501E910A42 Acct Session ID: Unknown Handle: 0xE200001A Current Policy: POLICY_Gi1/0/10 Local Policies: Service Template: DEFAULT_LINKSEC_POLICY_SHOULD_SECURE (priority 150) Server Policies: Per-User ACL: GigabitEthernet1/0/10#v4#7205C4C : permit 17 any eq 68 any : permit 17 any eq 67 any : permit ip any 10.2.0.0 0.0.255.255 : permit ip any 10.21.0.0 0.0.255.255 : permit ip any 10.48.0.0 0.0.255.255 : permit ip any 10.64.0.0 0.0.255.255 : deny ip any any Method status list: Method State dot1x Authc Success\nShow access list. \nshow access list acl_name\nshow access list GigabitEthernet1/0/10#v4#7205CF4 Extended IP access list GigabitEthernet1/0/10#v4#7205CF4 (per-user) 100 permit udp any any eq bootpc 101 permit ip any 10.2.0.0 0.0.255.255 102 permit ip any 10.21.0.0 0.0.255.255 103 permit ip any 10.48.0.0 0.0.255.255 104 permit ip any 10.64.0.0 0.0.255.255 105 deny ip any any\nDebug the configuration if needed. \nYou can use the following tools when debugging dACL assignment:\nPCAP: Verify that Access-Accept is being delivered to the endpoint.\ndebug radius all: Verify that the dACL is passed to the RADIUS server.\n001567: May 7 13:46:15.269: RADIUS: Received from id 1645/111 13.90.229.234:10330, Access-Accept, len 407 001568: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: authenticator 22 E2 C9 E9 88 E8 82 58 - F6 09 C9 D1 5F 2C 5A 78 001569: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Vendor, Microsoft [26] 58 001570: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: MS-MPPE-Recv-Key [17] 52 * 001571: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Vendor, Microsoft [26] 58 001572: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: MS-MPPE-Send-Key [16] 52 * 001573: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Vendor, Cisco [26] 44 001574: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Cisco AVpair [1] 38 \"ip:inacl#100=permit 17 any eq 68 any\" 001575: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Vendor, Cisco [26] 44 001576: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Cisco AVpair [1] 38 \"ip:inacl#100=permit 17 any eq 67 any\" 001577: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Vendor, Cisco [26] 72 001578: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Cisco AVpair [1] 66 \"ip:inacl#101=permit ip 10.2.0.0 0.0.255.255 10.2.0.0 0.0.255.255\" 001579: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Vendor, Cisco [26] 74 001580: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Cisco AVpair [1] 68 \"ip:inacl#102=permit ip 10.21.0.0 0.0.255.255 10.21.0.0 0.0.255.255\" 001581: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Vendor, Cisco [26] 36 001582: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: Cisco AVpair [1] 30 \"ip:inacl#103=deny ip any any\" 001583: May 7 13:46:15.270: RADIUS: User-Name [1] 21 \"kosh@vorlon.com\""

TACACS+ authorization policies let you define specific privileges of network administrators such as the ability to access specific services or run specific commands. These policies apply only to NAS devices, not to user devices.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Policies option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand menu, click on the TACACS+ AUTHORIZATION POLICIES tile. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the Create a new Policy link to create a new policy. \nNote: You can also click on the Edit link on the right-hand side of the selected line that represents an existing policy. The creation and editing processes are almost the same.\nIn the Policy Name field, enter the name for the new policy and in the Policy Description field, enter an optional description. \nOn the left-hand side, click on the Session-based > option, if you want to configure session-based TACACS+ authorization. \nSession-based authorization means that the NAS device will request TACACS+ authorization for the specific session. Once the session is authorized, NAS device administrator privileges depend on the authorized privilege level, configured on the NAS device.\nNote: The NAS device configuration decides whether it uses session-based or command-based authorization. You can define both session-based and command-based authorization in Portnox Cloud if you use both types in your NAS devices, but each NAS device will only use one of these two groups of settings.\nIn the Privilege level field, select the user privilege level. \nProfessional NAS devices can be configured to use 16 different privilege levels from 0 to 15. Each privilege level gives the NAS administrator access to specific commands and arguments. Privilege level 15 usually means full control of the NAS device. Many devices use three levels by default, where level 0 only allows a few commands, level 1 allows read-only access, and level 15 allows full control.\nIn the Session timeout field, select the session timeout in minutes. \nThe value 0 means no timeout. After the session timeout expires, the NAS device will either disconnect the administrator or reduce their privilege level. This behavior is configured on the NAS device.\nOptional: In the Autocommand field, enter the command that the NAS device will run immediately after the administrator is authorized. \nFor example, show running-config.\nIn the Allowed services section, click on the Add new link to add a new allowed service, enter the name of the service, and then click on the Add button. \nBy default, only the shell service is allowed but you can let the administrator access additional services like tty-server, connection, system, or firewall. If you remove all services, the administrator will have no privileges to access the NAS device.\nNote: If this setting conflicts with the privileges in the selected privilege level, the NAS device implementation decides which has higher priority.\nIn the Custom attributes section, click on the Add new link to add a new custom attribute as a Key and Value pair, and then click on the Add button. \nFor example, you can add standard TACACS+ attributes such as idletime or nohangup, as well as any attributes specific to your NAS devices.\nOn the left-hand side, click on the Command-based > option, if you want to configure command-based TACACS+ authorization. \nCommand-based authorization means that the NAS device will request TACACS+ authorization for each command that the NAS administrator tries to execute.\nNote: The NAS device configuration decides whether it uses session-based or command-based authorization. You can define both session-based and command-based authorization in Portnox Cloud if you use both types in your NAS devices, but each NAS device will only use one of these two groups of settings.\nActivate the Deny access to all commands by default checkbox if you want to allow administrators to use only selected commands. \nYou can use command-based authorization in a blacklist or whitelist mode.\nIf this setting is not activated, command-based authorization works in blacklist mode: you enter only the names of blacklisted commands.\nIf this setting is activated, command-based authorization works in whitelist mode: you enter only the names of whitelisted commands.\nIn the Forbidden/Allowed commands section, click on the Add new link to add a new command, enter the name of the command, and then click on the Add button. \nAll commands on this list will be treated as blacklisted or whitelisted, depending on the Deny access to all commands by default setting.\nIn the Custom attributes section, click on the Add new link to add a new custom attribute as a Key and Value pair, and then click on the Add button. \nFor example, you can add standard TACACS+ attributes such as idletime or nohangup, as well as any attributes specific to your NAS devices.\nTo save your policy settings, click on the Save button on the bottom right of the page. \nResult: You created or edited a TACACS+ authorization policy.

To create your own Cloud RADIUS instance, follow the instructions in the following topic: Create Cloud RADIUS servers.\nThe guest Wi-Fi network is a separate Wi-Fi network with a unique SSID, which lets guests of your organization access the Internet and limited local resources with no connection to the corporate network. When a guest connects to your guest Wi-Fi network using a shared password or no password, they can be redirected to a captive portal. After they complete the steps in the captive portal, the Wi-Fi access point connects them to the Internet and selected local resources.\nMost Wi-Fi controllers allow you to create a guest network and let you create a simple captive portal managed by the controller. The Portnox Cloud captive portal gives you some unique choices such as the ability for organization employees to authorize guests. This is possible, because it works together with the RADIUS server.\nThere is no universal standard or protocol for captive portals. The Portnox Cloud captive portal works only with the following network controllers and their internal standards:\nCisco Meraki\nCisco\nHPE Aruba\nRUCKUS Networks\nJuniper Mist\nExtreme WiNG\nAerohive (legacy, now Extreme)\nFortinet\nUbiquiti UniFi\nWatchGuard\nImportant: The guest network and the Cloud-managed employee network cannot use the same SSID. If you already have the SSID configured or referenced in one of the Portnox Cloud group settings, you will encounter the following error when trying to access the captive portal on the same SSID: Cannot proceed due to next errors: Access denied.\nTo set up a Portnox Cloud guest Wi-Fi network, follow these steps.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the heading. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the Add a captive portal service link to add a new captive portal. \nImportant: You can create a maximum of 10 captive portals in Portnox Cloud. If you try to add more, you will encounter an error.\nIn the URL field, enter a unique suffix that will identify this captive portal. \nAll your captive portal URLs have a similar format: https://guests.portnox.com/your_organization_identifier/suffix , where your_organization_identifier is a unique string of characters generated for your organization by Portnox Cloud, and suffix is the value of this field.\nIn this example, we used the suffix homeworld but you can use any suffix you like.\nIn the Authentication type field, select the type of authentication that users will be asked for when connecting to the captive portal. \nPortnox Cloud Guest: Only guests manually added by the Portnox Cloud administrator () can authenticate. The administrator receives the credentials via email and needs to manually deliver them to the guest user.\nNo authentication (disclaimer only): Guests do not need to authenticate, only accept the disclaimer or terms of service.\nSponsored Guest: Guests are asked to provide an email address of a sponsor from the organization. Once confirmed, they can create a password for further access. Portnox Cloud administrators can configure a password policy for these passwords.\nThe sponsor receives an email request to confirm.\nIf the sponsor confirms, the guest receives a one-time passcode valid for 2 hours, and can enter the guest network upon first setting up their password.\nSMS authentication: Guests enter their mobile number and then receive a code sent to this number via a text message (SMS). This code lets them set their password and join the guest network.\nIn the Dynamic session timeout field, select the period after which the guest session expires. \nWhile the session is active, if the guest connects to the guest Wi-Fi network again, they won’t need to provide their credentials (if required) again. After the session expires, if the guest is still connected, they will be disconnected. To reconnect, they must access the captive portal again and provide credentials (if required).\nImportant: Dynamic session timeout defines how long a guest account remains valid in Portnox Cloud. Once this period ends, the account is deleted from the Portnox guest network configuration. However, some NAS devices may still cache the guest’s authorization, allowing them to reconnect to the captive portal SSID even after expiration. \nFor Mist, WatchGuard, and UniFi NAS devices, Portnox Cloud can automatically sync the expiration time with the device, preventing this issue. For other NAS devices, you’ll need to manually configure the session expiration in the NAS settings to match the value set in Portnox Cloud. Refer to your NAS documentation for guidance.\nIn the Disclaimer (“Acceptable Use” statement): field, enter any formatted text that you want the users to be asked to accept before they connect to the guest Wi-Fi network. \nIn the Logo field, click on the Portnox™ Cloud logo to replace it with your own logo or click on the 🗑 icon to show no logo in your captive portal. \nClick on the Save button to save your changes and generate a URL and an IP for your captive portal. \nIn the Captive Portal URL field, click on the ⧉ icon to copy the unique URL of your captive portal. \nSave this value, for example, in a text file. You will need to enter this value in the configuration of your network controller. Refer to your network controller documentation for specific instructions.\nNote: This value is displayed only after saving the configuration of the captive portal.\nIn the IP (for walled garden) field, copy the IP addresses of the captive portal. \nSave these values, for example, in a text file. You will need to enter these IP addresses in the configuration of your network controller as a walled garden. This means: the IP addresses that the guest can connect to before they authenticate in the captive portal. If not, the guest device will not be able to access the captive portal.\nNote: This value is displayed only after saving the configuration of the captive portal.\nIn the Shared Secret field, enter the shared secret specific for the controller. \nRuckus: Enter the NBI password generated in Ruckus ZoneDirector.\nMist: Enter the API secret value from the guest portal configuration in the Mist management console.\nWatchGuard: Enter the shared secret that you entered or will enter in the WatchGuard XTM.\nFor other brands of controllers, you do not need to enter a shared secret.\nResult: You have added a captive portal service.\nNote: The guest Wi-Fi captive portal imposes a daily restriction on the number of new guests, determined by your Portnox license. You have the option to expand this limit by purchasing additional packages (for details, see our pricing page). The user count resets on midnight, based on the time zone configured for the tenant. \nPortnox Cloud counts the number of concurrently connected guests devices. If a device remains connected, the count will be reduced by one on the following day. However, if a guest device gets disconnected, and if the duration of the previous connection has not exceeded the value specified in the Session Expiration property, the next connection from the same device will be allowed without authentication in the Captive Portal. Otherwise, the connection will be counted as a new device, so the count will increase by one.\nFor specific instructions on setting up guest Wi-Fi access on specific network controllers, see the following topic: Configure wireless devices to work with Portnox Cloud."

  "text": "Configure Ethernet devices to work with Portnox Cloud\nIn this collection of documents, you will find specific instructions for configuring Ethernet-based NAS devices to access the Portnox™ Cloud RADIUS servers and provide AAA services.\nImportant: The instructions for setting up third-party devices may change when the manufacturers update their firmware or release new models. To get the most accurate and current configuration guidance, please refer to the documentation provided by the manufacturer.\nIf your manufacturer or device is not listed in the left-hand side menu, here are general instructions how to configure most Ethernet switches for 802.1X with Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers. Most switches are configured using commands, not a graphical user interface.\nConfigure the Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers. \nCreate or edit a group so that it supports wired access. \nThis step is necessary so that Portnox Cloud can manage network access. If you skip this step, you will not be able to authenticate, even if you configure your switch properly.\nFor information on how to configure Cloud groups, see the following topic: Create a group.\nAdd Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers to the switch configuration. \nTo complete this step, you will need your specific IP addresses, port numbers, and secret keys that you obtained in the previous step. You can add just one server (for example, the US server only) or both of them (US and EU), but this may be limited by the choice you made when you created your Portnox tenant.\nIn this step, you can also add the local RADIUS proxy, which will be used to authenticate current clients in case of an Internet outage. You should add it using your local IP address and the port numbers and secret key that you obtained in the previous step.\nCommands used by different switches to add RADIUS servers could look like this (we’re providing this so it’s easier for you to search in your vendor’s documentation):\nradius-server name address ipv4 ip_address auth-port auth port acct-port acct port key secret key\nradius-server host ip_address auth-port auth port acct-port acct port key secret key\nradius-server host ip_address auth-port auth port acct-port acct port key 0 secret key\nradius-server host ip_address auth-port auth port acct-port acct port default key secret key\nset radius-server ip_address port auth port secret secret key\nConfigure RADIUS authentication on the switch and optionally MAC address bypass (MAB) authentication. \nThe process to configure RADIUS authentication for your switch is very specific, but it usually includes commands to globally enable 802.1X authentication, 802.1X accounting, and optionally MAC address bypass authentication as well as the definition of VLANs that devices will be assigned to if they successfully authenticate or fail authentication.\nMAC address bypass authentication is needed only if you must authenticate some of your devices, for example, IoT devices, using only their MAC addresses.\nCommands used by different switches to enable 802.1X authentication and accounting could look like this:\ndot1x enable\naaa authentication port-access eap-radius\naaa authentication dot1x default group group_name\naaa accounting dot1x default start-stop radius\nset protocols dot1x authenticator auth_group servers_group\nConfigure the switch ports/interfaces for RADIUS authentication and optionally MAC address authentication. \nIn this step, you decide which ports or interfaces on your switch should be used for client devices. You can set these ports/interfaces to authenticate devices using RADIUS and/or using MAC addresses. Usually, you are able to provide a range of ports to configure at the same time or configure ports one by one as needed.\nCommands used by different switches to configure interfaces/ports could look like this:\ninterface interface_name\nauthentication port-control auto\nmab\ninterface interface_name\naaa authentication port-access auth-precedence dot1x mac-auth\naaa authentication port-access dot1x authenticator\nenable\naaa authentication port-access mac-auth\nenable\ninterface range interface_range\ndot1x authentication\ndot1x port-control auto\ndot1x mac-auth-bypass\naaa port-access authenticator port_range\naaa port-access mac-based port_range\nConfigure the critical authentication process on the switch. \nMany modern switch models offer functionality that is called critical auth VLAN, critical authentication, fallback VLAN, authserver timeout vlan, auth service-unavailable VLAN, 802.1X authentication escape or similar. All these functions mean one thing: if for any reason your switch cannot reach the Portnox Cloud servers, you can decide that any current or new devices are automatically assigned to a specific VLAN, for example, to allow them access to the Internet but to keep your sensitive networks secure.\nNote: While this is not a necessary step, we strongly encourage you to see if your switch supports such functionality. This will prevent your clients from being completely denied access to the network in case of an external outage.\nCommands used by different switches to enable a critical VLAN could look like this:\ninterface interface_name\nauthentication event server dead action authorize vlan vlan_number\naaa port-access interface_name critical-auth-data-vlan vlan_number\ninterface range interface_range dot1x critical-vlan vlan_number\nset interface interface_name server-fail vlan_number"

  "text": "Configure wireless captive portals to work with Portnox Cloud\nIn this collection of documents, you will find specific instructions for configuring captive portals on wireless NAS devices to work with the Portnox™ Cloud guest network.\nYou can use captive portals with wireless NAS devices and Portnox Cloud in two ways: with guests managed by Cloud, or with guests managed by the NAS.\nTo learn more about configuring guest access in Portnox Cloud, read the following topic: Configure a guest Wi-Fi network.\nGuests managed by Portnox Cloud\nThe guest user connects to the guest SSID on the NAS.\nThe guest’s device recognizes a captive portal and opens the guest’s browser.\nThe guest’s browser opens a web page served by the NAS device’s internal web server.\nThe NAS device’s internal web server redirects the guest’s browser to a URL managed by Portnox Cloud. This is usually either a meta-refresh or a 30x error redirect.\nPortnox Cloud manages the guest’s access according to Portnox guest network settings. For example: the guest might receive credentials via a text message or ask an employee (sponsor) to vouch for them.\nIf the guest successfully authenticates based on the guest requirements, the Portnox Cloud back-end registers this in the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server.\nThe guest’s browser is redirected back to a success URL, which the NAS device recognizes as confirmation of successful authorization.\nThe NAS device validates this fact using the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server.\nThe guest is granted access to the network.\nNote: This is a recommended approach. All the topics in this collection describe this type of configuration.\nThere are several advantages of this approach:\nGuests and employees are managed using a single platform (Portnox Cloud), providing greater flexibility, security, and scalability.\nGuest management is platform-independent. You can manage multiple captive portals together, regardless of the NAS devices running the guest SSIDs.\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that Portnox Cloud supports it only for the following NAS device manufacturers: Cisco, Cisco Meraki, Aruba, Ruckus, Mist, Extreme Wing, Fortinet, Aerohive (legacy), WatchGuard, and Ubiquiti UniFi. Other captive portals are currently not supported because there is no standard for captive portal integration with third parties. Each manufacturer’s captive portal interacts differently with third-party URLs and RADIUS servers, requiring custom integration for each manufacturer.\nGuests managed by the internal NAS engine\nThe guest user connects to the guest SSID. The guest’s device recognizes a captive portal and opens the guest’s browser.\nThe NAS device directs the user to a URL controlled by the NAS device’s internal captive portal engine.\nThe NAS device manages the user’s access according to its internal settings. Access options depend on the functionality of the NAS device’s captive portal engine.\nIn this approach, there is no involvement of Portnox Cloud. Guests can be managed fully by the NAS device without any Portnox Cloud involvement. However, you can use Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers to authenticate users if you want to use the captive portal for authenticated users, not just for guests.\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that each captive portal must be configured and managed independently, which consumes valuable human resources and makes unified security management much more difficult, especially for larger organizations. We recommend this approach only if Portnox Cloud does not support your manufacturer’s NAS equipment."

In such cases, you create Portnox accounts for each user, based on their corporate email address.\nLDAP account\nIf you use an external authentication repository, you can create an account in Portnox Cloud that is linked to the LDAP user from that repository.\nContractor account\nIf you need to let contractors access your network, and you cannot create Portnox accounts for them because they don’t have a corporate email address, you can create a contractor account based on any email address and a password.\nMAC-based account\nIf you have devices that do not support 802.1X authentication and cannot provide any user credentials to the cloud RADIUS server, you can create accounts for such devices linked to their MAC addresses. The MAC address is treated as the identifier that such devices use to access the network.\nNote: We recommend that you do not create MAC-based accounts for devices that support the 802.1X protocol, and that are used by people, because it lets anyone with access to such a device access the company network.\nDevice-type account\nIf you do not want to create individual MAC-based accounts because there are a lot of unmanned devices that need access to your network, you can create a device-type account. For example, you can create an account for all devices of a specific type, from a specific manufacturer, with a model name that contains a specific string.\nOn the Devices screen, in the ACCOUNTS tab, accounts are represented by top-level entries, and devices within these accounts are represented by nested entries, as seen on the example screenshot below.\nNote: Take care when blocking, deactivating or deleting accounts and devices – click on the correct checkboxes before clicking on the action button.\nWhat are groups in Portnox Cloud?\nA group in Portnox Cloud represents a group of accounts that share similar characteristics.\nYou can create groups depending on your needs and company organization. For example, you can create groups for the finance department, the marketing department, and the IT department. Alternatively, you can create groups for network administrators, system administrators, and non-administrative users.\nYou can assign users to groups manually or you can automatically connect groups in Portnox Cloud with groups in external identity management platforms such as Entra ID, Google Workplace, Okta, AD, or LDAP servers.\nYou can define basic access privileges for all members of the group. For example, you can allow the group to access specific Wi-Fi networks, wired networks, and VPNs. Detailed privileges are controlled using policies that you can assign to the group.\nYou can create a maximum of 100 groups.\nNote: When a new user/account accesses the network, it will be assigned to the first group where it matches the criteria. Groups are checked in order of the priority listed on the Groups screen. At least one group always exists: the Default group. All accounts that are not assigned to any other group are automatically assigned to this group. \nWhat are policies in Portnox Cloud?\nA policy in Portnox Cloud represents a set of settings, privileges, and requirements, which is assigned to one or more groups. You cannot assign policies directly to accounts.\nPolicies let you configure settings that Portnox Cloud applies to the group in different conditions. For example, you can create a policy that assigns the connected device to a specific VLAN. In a policy, you can also decide what to do when authentication fails, for example, quarantine the device in a special VLAN.\nYou can assign a policy to different groups but each group can only have one policy of each type. You can have multiple access control policies applied to different sites.\nPolicy types\nAccess control policies\nIn an access control policy, you decide what the NAS device should do with the user device when the user device succeeds with authentication, fails it, violates a risk policy, or is blocked by the administrator. If successful, the NAS can assign the device to a specific VLAN or ACL. In other cases, the NAS can assign the device to a quarantine VLAN or deny access to the network. \nNote: At least one access control policy always exists: the System Default Policy. All groups that are not assigned any other access control policy are automatically assigned this policy. \nEach access control policy can have maximum 25 rules.\nRisk assessment policies\nIn a risk assessment policy, you decide if Portnox Cloud should alert you or if the NAS should deny network access if the risk score of the device is too high. The risk score of the device can be calculated based on different factors such as geolocation, system settings, installed applications, operating system versions, drive encryption, and more. \nNote: Portnox Cloud can calculate the risk score only if the device has the Portnox AgentP installed or if you integrate Cloud with an endpoint management solution such as Microsoft Intune.\nNote: At least one risk assessment policy always exists: the System Default Policy. All groups that are not assigned any other risk assessment policy are automatically assigned this policy. \nYou can create a maximum of 15 risk assessment policies.\nRemediation policies\nIn a remediation policy, you decide what actions the Portnox AgentP should automatically take on user devices. For example, you can decide that AgentP should automatically update the antivirus software, turn on the firewall, remove an application, and more. \nNote: Portnox Cloud can enforce remediation policies only if the device has the Portnox AgentP installed.\nCustom RADIUS attribute policies\nIn a custom RADIUS attribute policy, you can define up to 30 custom attributes and later assign them to groups, allowing you to control which custom attributes are sent to which NAS devices when the connecting device is in a specific group. Custom RADIUS attributes are used by many NAS devices to extend the capabilities of RADIUS authentication and authorization. They let you include additional information in RADIUS messages, enabling more granular control over access and policies.\nYou can create a maximum of 25 custom RADIUS attribute policies with a maximum of 50 attributes per policy, a maximum of 20 mapping rules inside a group mapping, a maximum of 5 levels of nesting in the condition builder query, and a maximum of 30 condition rules in the condition builder query.\nTACACS+ authorization policies\nIn a TACACS+ authorization policy, you can decide what members of the group can do when accessing a TACACS+ NAS device. You can define which commands are allowed and which are forbidden, as well as control parameters of the session such as the privilege level, the timeout, and allowed services.\nWhat are sites in Portnox Cloud?\nA site in Portnox Cloud represents a physical location, such as an office, where a specific NAS device is located.\nYou can assign NAS devices to sites manually or based on the NAS device IP address.\nThe only setting that is specific to a site is the access control policy.\nNAS devices in sites can have one of the following icons:\n– Wired device\n– Wireless device\n– RADIUS/TACACS+ (terminal/shell) direct access\n– Other\nNote: Your list of sites may contain a site called Clutter. It’s a special site that contains all cases when Portnox Cloud cannot identify the NAS that is associated to the device. There can be several reasons why Portnox Cloud cannot identify the NAS, for example: the NAS may have been deleted from the system, or RADIUS packets may be using 0.0.0.0 as the NAS IP or 00-00-00-00-00-00 to represent the MAC address of the NAS."

  "text": "What is onboarding in Portnox Cloud?\nIn this topic, you will learn about the meaning of the term onboarding and the activities that are considered part of onboarding in Portnox™ Cloud.\nWhat is onboarding?\nIn Portnox Cloud, we use the term onboarding to refer to all the manual activities that a user must do to connect their devices to networks managed by Cloud, as well as to automatic activities and configurations pushed to devices by administrators.\nPortnox Cloud offers you several ways to authenticate with your network, and the Cloud administrator decides which ones are available to the users in the company.\nIn addition to manual onboarding by the user, the Portnox Cloud administrator can also do automatic onboarding of company devices using an endpoint management solution such as Microsoft Intune or Jamf.\nThe following are the different types of onboarding:\nOnboarding with credentials\nThe Portnox Cloud administrator can permit users to authenticate manually using credentials, which typically include a login and password. If you have integrated Cloud with an external authentication repository, Cloud communicates with that repository to verify the user’s credentials. Users with contractor accounts receive their network access password via email when the administrator creates their account in Cloud.\nIf the user is onboarding with credentials, they can configure their network connection manually or they can use the Portnox Cloud self-onboarding portal to receive and run a provisioning file. Cloud offers provisioning for iOS, Windows, and macOS (not for Android or Linux).\nNote: If you would like to onboard using credentials, please read the following topic on the security of credential-based authentication: EAP methods and their security.\nThe following are examples of onboarding manually using credentials:\nOnboard a Windows device to a Wi-Fi network with credentials\nOnboard a Windows device to a wired network with credentials\nOnboard an Android device to a Wi-Fi network with credentials\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nThe following are examples of onboarding using the self-onboarding portal and credentials:\nOnboard a Windows device to a wired network with credentials through self-onboarding\nOnboard a Windows device to a Wi-Fi network with credentials through self-onboarding\nOnboard a macOS device to a Wi-Fi network with credentials through self-onboarding\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nOnboarding with certificates\nThe Portnox Cloud administrator can require users to authenticate using a user/device certificate. To begin the manual onboarding process using a certificate, the user needs to go to the self-onboarding portal. In this portal, they receive a certificate to download, which they need to install on their device. After they install the certificate, they need to configure their operating system to connect to the network using the certificate. They can configure the operating system using the self-onboarding portal and provisioning (for supported operating systems) or manually.\nThe following are examples of onboarding using certificates:\nOnboard a Windows device to a wired network with certificates\nOnboard a Windows device to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nOnboard a macOS device to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nOnboard an iPhone to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nOnboard an Android device to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nOnboarding with AgentP\nThe simplest way to onboard users in Portnox Cloud is by using a lightweight software agent called Portnox AgentP, which is compatible with popular operating systems on computers and mobile devices. The user can download and install AgentP from the Download Portnox AgentP page or from the official application store for their mobile device. You can read more about the benefits of AgentP in the following topic: What is Portnox AgentP?.\nTo onboard with AgentP, the user runs AgentP, logs in with their credentials or through integration with an authentication repository. Then, AgentP takes care of network configuration as well as downloads and installs the necessary certificates (in operating systems other than Windows, you must configure wired networks manually).\nThe following are examples of onboarding using AgentP:\nOnboard a Windows device to a Wi-Fi or wired network with AgentP\nOnboard a macOS device to a Wi-Fi or wired network with AgentP\nOnboard an iPhone to a Wi-Fi network with AgentP\nOnboard an Android phone to a Wi-Fi network with AgentP\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nOnboarding with MAC addresses\nApart from manned devices like mobiles and computers, Portnox Cloud also allows you to connect unmanned devices such as printers, scanners, surveillance cameras, and other IoT equipment. Since these devices don’t support the 802.1X protocol, they can’t authenticate using credentials or certificates, and it’s not possible to install AgentP on them. In such cases, these devices are identified based on their MAC addresses.\nWhen connecting these devices to wired networks, you only need to physically connect them using an Ethernet cable. However, when connecting them to company Wi-Fi networks, additional setup may be required. For example, some devices might prompt you to enter a password for the company network, even if that network uses the WPA2 Enterprise protocol, which doesn’t support a common password.\nThe following are examples of onboarding using MAC addresses:\nOnboard an IoT device by creating a MAC-based account\nOnboard an IoT device by creating a MAC-based account using the registration portal\nOnboard IoT devices by creating MAC-based accounts automatically\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side.\nAutomatic onboarding with endpoint management\nIf you use an unified endpoint management (UEM) solution such as Microsoft Intune or Jamf, you can distribute configurations and/or request certificates using the SCEP protocol for all your company devices and your users don’t need to onboard manually.\nThe following are examples of onboarding using UEM solutions:\nOnboard Windows devices with certificates using Microsoft Intune and SCEP\nOnboard Chromebooks with certificates using Google Workspace and SCEP\nOnboard macOS devices with certificates using Jamf and SCEP\nOnboard Windows devices with AgentP using Group Policy\nOnboard devices with AgentP using Microsoft Intune\nOnboard Windows devices with AgentP in unattended or kiosk mode\nFor more platforms, see the menu on the left-hand side."

To get the most accurate and current configuration guidance on switch 802.1X configuration, we strongly recommend that you refer to the documentation provided by Dell on these topics for your particular device model and firmware version.\nImportant: All values in this configuration are examples. Make sure to adjust the configuration to your individual RADIUS server addresses, ports, and keys, as well as device interfaces, limits, and VLANs by replacing the values that are presented as underlined italics.\nSet all ports on the switch to force authorized (this includes Ten Gigabit interfaces, if applicable). \nImportant: This is a temporary step before you can turn on auto mode. If you do not set all the ports to force authorized before turning on dot1x authentication and setting up your RADIUS servers, all ports will be blocked.

The name of the account will be the name of the network adapter vendor, which is automatically identified using the MAC address.\nAssign the account to the Default group.\nAdd the device to this MAC-based account.\nIf agentless IoT device fingerprinting is on (), the name of the device will be automatically identified using the MAC address of its adapter.\nIf agentless IoT device fingerprinting is off, the name of the device will be the MAC address of its adapter.\nAs a result, the device will immediately have access to the network with privileges of the Default group. This will be confirmed by an 802.1X authentication success alert specifying the device connected via auto-onboarding.\nOptional: Click on the Automatically assign devices a VLAN, rather than the Portnox default group checkbox to activate it and enter the VLAN number in the adjacent field. \nIf this setting is turned on, new devices that connect to the network will be quarantined in the selected VLAN and the automatically created accounts will be treated as quarantine accounts.\nTo remove the device from quarantine and let it access the network, you have to manually add the device’s MAC address to another MAC-based account and delete the quarantine account.\nClick on the Save button to save your changes or click on the Cancel button to abandon all changes. \nAfter you click on one of the buttons, Portnox Cloud will exit the edit mode.\nNote: By default, if a device doesn’t connect to the network for 90 days, its MAC address is removed from the MAB account. You can change this period or disable this option here: . This does not mean that the device will be removed from the Portnox Cloud account. It means that if the device has been inactive for the configured period, and it tries to authenticate again after that period using its MAC address, it will no longer be recognized. The process for the Inactive MAC-addresses purge function is as follows: \nYou add a MAC address to a MAB account – the day when you do this counts as day 1.\nThe day counter increases every day at midnight tenant-time,\nAny time the device with the MAC address authenticates, the counter resets to 1.\nThe moment that the counter reaches the configured limit, the MAC address is removed from the MAB account.\nThe device with the MAC address is no longer in the MAB account so it cannot authenticate."

To learn more about AD DS, see Active Directory Domain Services Overview on Microsoft Learn.\nThe devices that you want to manage must be joined to the domain, and users that you want to manage must use domain credentials to log on to their devices.\nYou must have permission to edit the Group Policy in the domain.\nPerform the following tasks on your AD DS server.\nCreate and share a GPO folder\nIn this section, you will create a folder that contains AgentP installation files, and that will be used by other computers for installation.\nCreate a GPO directory in the local file system of the AD DS server. \nYou can create the directory with any name you like and anywhere in the local file system, as long as you be able to share the directory as a folder.\nFor example, create the directory C:\\GPO\\.\nDownload AgentP installation files for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows devices. \nOpen the AgentP download page (clear.portnox.com/agentinstall) in the browser on the AD DS server. \nScroll down to the Windows installation files and click on the tiles: Windows *.msi for x64 and Windows *.msi for x86. \nSave the downloaded files in the directory you created in the previous step. \nRename the files to remove the version number. \nThe files should be named PortnoxAgentP64.msi and PortnoxAgentP86.msi and should be located in the directory created earlier.\nShare the folder that you created previously. \nRight-click on the folder in the directory tree and select the Properties option from the context menu. \nIn the Properties window, click on the Sharing tab, and then click on the Advanced Sharing button. \nIn the Advanced Sharing window, activate the Share this folder checkbox, and then click on the Permissions button. \nIn the Permissions window, click on the Authenticated Users group, and make sure that the checkbox is activated in the Read permissions row and in the Allow column. \nClick on the OK button to close the Permissions window. \nClick on the OK button to close the Advanced Sharing window. \nIn the Properties window, click on the Security tab, click on the Domain Users group, and verify that there are check marks in the Allow column for the following rows: Read & execute, List folder contents, and Read. \nIf not, click on the Edit button to edit permissions.\nClick on the Close button to close the Properties window. \nResult: You shared a folder with AgentP installation files, which will be used by the GPO objects.\nCreate GPOs for 64-bit and 32-bit Windows\nIn this section, you will create a Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that will be used to automatically deploy AgentP on devices with 64-bit or 32-bit versions of Windows.\nRun the Group Policy Management app. \nFor example, start typing group into the search field on the taskbar and then click on the Group Policy Management app entry.\nCreate a GPO for 64-bit systems. \nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management window, right-click on the Group Policy Objects node and select the New option from the context menu. \nIn the New GPO window, enter a Name for the new 64-bit system GPO, and click on the OK button. \nIn this example, we used the name AgentP install policy for 64-bit but you can use any name you like.\nCreate a GPO for 32-bit systems. \nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management window, right-click on the Group Policy Objects node and select the New option from the context menu. \nIn the New GPO window, enter a Name for the new 32-bit system GPO, and click on the OK button. \nIn this example, we used the name AgentP install policy for 32-bit but you can use any name you like.\nResult: You created two GPOs, one for 64-bit Windows, and one for 32-bit Windows.\nCreate a software installation package for 64-bit systems and user assignment\nIn this section, you will create a software installation package that will be used to automatically deploy AgentP on devices with 64-bit versions of Windows and assign it to the users of these devices.\nNote: While many organizations choose user-based assignment, we recommend device-based assignment instead, because with user-based assignment, AgentP would need to be installed every time the user logs on. If you want to create a package to assign to devices, not users, go to the following section instead: Create a software installation package for 64-bit systems and device assignment.\nRun the Group Policy Management app. \nFor example, start typing group into the search field on the taskbar and then click on the Group Policy Management app entry.\nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management window, right-click on the Group Policy Object that you created earlier for 64-bit systems and select the Edit option from the context menu. \nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management Editor window, expand the nodes, right-click on the Software installation node, and select from the context menu. \nIn the Open window, browse to the PortnoxAgentP64.msi file in the folder that you created and shared in an earlier task. \nIf a warning appears saying that Windows cannot verify that the path is a network location, click on the Yes button.\nIn the Deploy Software window, select the Advanced option and click on the OK button. \nIn the Properties window, in the General tab, make sure that the Name is Portnox AgentP. \nIn the Properties window, in the Deployment tab, in the Deployment type section, select the Assigned option, and then in the Deployment options section, activate the following checkboxes: Uninstall this application when it falls out of scope of management and Install this application at logon. \nClick on the OK button to close the Properties window. \nResult: You created a software installation package for 64-bit systems and user assignment.\nCreate a software installation package for 64-bit systems and device assignment\nIn this section, you will create a software installation package that will be used to automatically deploy AgentP on devices with 64-bit versions of Windows and assign it to these devices.\nRun the Group Policy Management app. \nFor example, start typing group into the search field on the taskbar and then click on the Group Policy Management app entry.\nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management window, right-click on the Group Policy Object that you created earlier for 64-bit systems and select the Edit option from the context menu. \nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management Editor window, expand the nodes, right-click on the Software installation node, and select from the context menu. \nIn the Open window, browse to the PortnoxAgentP64.msi file in the folder that you created and shared in an earlier task. \nIf a warning appears saying that Windows cannot verify that the path is a network location, click on the Yes button.\nIn the Deploy Software window, select the Advanced option and click on the OK button. \nIn the Properties window, in the General tab, make sure that the Name is Portnox AgentP. \nIn the Properties window, in the Deployment tab, in the Deployment type section, select the Assigned option, and then in the Deployment options section, activate the following checkbox: Uninstall this application when it falls out of scope of management. \nClick on the OK button to close the Properties window. \nResult: You created a software installation package for 64-bit systems and device assignment.\nCreate a software installation package for 32-bit systems and user assignment\nIn this section, you will create a software installation package that will be used to automatically deploy AgentP on devices with 32-bit versions of Windows and assign it to the users of these devices.\nNote: While many organizations choose user-based assignment, we recommend device-based assignment instead, because with user-based assignment, AgentP would need to be installed every time the user logs on. If you want to create a package to assign to devices, not users, go to the following section instead: Create a software installation package for 32-bit systems and device assignment.\nRun the Group Policy Management app. \nFor example, start typing group into the search field on the taskbar and then click on the Group Policy Management app entry.\nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management window, right-click on the Group Policy Object that you created earlier for 32-bit systems and select the Edit option from the context menu. \nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management Editor window, expand the nodes, right-click on the Software installation node, and select from the context menu. \nIn the Open window, browse to the PortnoxAgentP86.msi file in the folder that you created and shared in an earlier task. \nIf a warning appears saying that Windows cannot verify that the path is a network location, click on the Yes button.\nIn the Deploy Software window, select the Advanced option and click on the OK button. \nIn the Properties window, in the General tab, make sure that the Name is Portnox AgentP. \nIn the Properties window, in the Deployment tab, in the Deployment type section, select the Assigned option, and then in the Deployment options section, activate the following checkboxes: Uninstall this application when it falls out of scope of management and Install this application at logon. Then, click on the Advanced button. \nIn the Advanced Deployment Options window, deactivate the following checkbox: Make this 32-bit X86 application available to Win64 machines. \nClick on the OK button to close the Properties window. \nResult: You created a software installation package for 32-bit systems and device assignment.\nCreate a software installation package for 32-bit systems and device assignment\nIn this section, you will create a software installation package that will be used to automatically deploy AgentP on devices with 32-bit versions of Windows and assign it to these devices.\nRun the Group Policy Management app. \nFor example, start typing group into the search field on the taskbar and then click on the Group Policy Management app entry.\nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management window, right-click on the Group Policy Object that you created earlier for 32-bit systems and select the Edit option from the context menu. \nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management Editor window, expand the nodes, right-click on the Software installation node, and select from the context menu. \nIn the Open window, browse to the PortnoxAgentP86.msi file in the folder that you created and shared in an earlier task. \nIf a warning appears saying that Windows cannot verify that the path is a network location, click on the Yes button.\nIn the Deploy Software window, select the Advanced option and click on the OK button. \nIn the Properties window, in the General tab, make sure that the Name is Portnox AgentP. \nIn the Properties window, in the Deployment tab, in the Deployment type section, select the Assigned option, and then in the Deployment options section, activate the following checkbox: Uninstall this application when it falls out of scope of management.

  "text": "Onboard a HP printer to a Wi-Fi network with certificates\nIn this topic, you will learn how to onboard using certificates, a HP printer compatible with 802.1X, the self-onboarding portal, a Windows computer, the HP Smart application, and a Wi-Fi network managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nBefore you begin, please note the following:\nIn this procedure, you use the Windows computer to configure the printer remotely, to get the certificate for the printer from the self-onboarding portal, and to add a password to the private key. You can also do these steps on a macOS system. However, to add a password to a private key on macOS, you will need to install and use third-party software such as OpenSSL.\nIf you want Portnox Cloud to generate a certificate for your printer through the self-onboarding portal, you must first create a user account that represents the printer in your integrated authentication repository or directly in Cloud. You must then be able to log in to the self-onboarding portal using that user account. After you complete the onboarding procedure, we recommend that you disable user logins for this account in your authentication repository or change the password if you use Cloud as your authentication repository. While we recommend creating individual accounts for each printer, you can also use a common user account for all printers or current user accounts.\nWe know that the following HP printer models are compatible with 802.1X Wi-Fi networks: HP LaserJet Pro 3001-3008, 4001-4004, MFP 3101-3108, 4101-4104. If your printer model is not one of these models, consult your documentation or contact your HP sales representative to find out if your HP printer is compatible with 802.1X. The HP Embedded Web Server currently does not support 802.1X for wired networks.\nUpdate the firmware on your printer to the latest version. We have encountered problems with 802.1X connectivity caused by outdated firmware.\nWe assume that you use the HP Smart software to manage and configure your printer. If not, please download and install HP Smart from the Microsoft Store and make sure you can connect to your printer using this software before you add the new certificate. While you can also configure the printer using the HP Embedded Web Server and a browser, this will become difficult after you install the new certificate, because HP printers use the same certificate for 802.1X authentication and for browser authentication, and browsers may be unable to recognize the self-signed certificates generated by Cloud.\nThe HP Embedded Web Server also supports authentication with credentials. However, it only supports LEAP and PEAP EAP methods, which are not secure. Therefore, we do not recommend and we do not provide instructions on setting up HP printers with credential-based 802.1X. If you must use credentials, Portnox Cloud supports PEAP, but only with the latest HP firmware installed.\nDownload the root CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nHP Smart asks you to upload a root CA certificate when configuring 802.1X connections. This is necessary so that the printer can verify the validity of Cloud RADIUS servers, which have certificates signed by this root CA certificate.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk to use it later. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nGenerate the user certificate for the printer\nIn this section, you will generate the certificate for the printer using the self-onboarding portal, and download it to your Windows computer.\nImportant: In the following steps, log in using the user account that you created for the printer, not your own user account.\nEnter the URL of the self-onboarding portal in your browser. \nIn Step 1, select the third option: Portnox account certificate management and click on the Next button. \nIn Step 2, you can select the Corporate email address option or the Corporate username and password option. Select the Corporate email address option if Portnox Cloud manages your user repository. Select the Corporate username and password option if you have integrated Cloud with an external repository. Proceed with the following steps depending on your choice. \nIf you have chosen Corporate email address: \nImportant: Only choose the Corporate email address option if Portnox Cloud manages your user repository. Cloud manages the user repository if it’s not integrated with any external repositories such as Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta Workforce Identity.\nIn the Email field, enter your corporate email address and click on the SIGN IN button. \nOpen your email client and find the email received from Portnox Cloud containing a one-time activation code. Copy this code to the clipboard. \nIn the self-onboarding portal, paste the code in the Activation code field and click on the CONFIRM button. \nIf you have chosen Corporate username and password: \nClick on the tile that represents the authentication repository you want to use to sign in. If you want to use credentials directly, enter your login and password and click on the SIGN IN button. \nComplete the steps needed to sign in. These steps depend on the chosen authentication repository. \nClick on the OBTAIN CERTIFICATE button to download the user certificate generated for your device. \nNote: If you want to replace a certificate you created earlier, for example, because the old one expires soon, click on the REISSUE CERTIFICATE button instead.\nResult: You downloaded the certificate and the corresponding private key.\nAdd a password to the printer certificate’s private key\nIn this section, you will temporarily import the downloaded certificate and then export it again, adding a password to the private key.\nBy default, private keys generated by Portnox Cloud and included with certificates have empty passwords. However, HP Smart does not accept an empty password for the private key, so you need to add a password to the private key to use the certificate with your HP printer.\nImport the downloaded certificate. \nDouble-click on the downloaded certificate file to temporarily install the certificate in your Windows certificate store. \nTo export the private key from the certificate, you must first install it, marking the private key as exportable. You cannot export the private key directly from the downloaded certificate without installing it.\nIn the first step of the Certificate Import Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn this step, you select the user certificate store by default. Note that you will delete the certificate after you add the password to the private key, so the selected certificate store is not important.\nIn the second step of the Certificate Import Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the third step of the Certificate Import Wizard, leave the Password field empty, activate the Mark this key as exportable checkbox, and then click on the Next button. \nYou must leave the password field empty because private keys included with Portnox Cloud certificates by default have empty passwords.\nIn the fourth step of the Certificate Import Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the fifth and final step of the Certificate Import Wizard, click on the Finish button. \nExport the certificate and the private key, adding a password to the private key. \nOpen the Windows Certificate Manager by typing manage user certificates in the Windows search bar and clicking on the Manage user certificates icon. \nIn the certmgr window, go to the folder and double-click on the certificate that you just imported. \nIn the Certificate window, go to the Details tab, and click on the Copy to File button. \nIn the first step of the Certificate Export Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the second step of the Certificate Export Wizard, select the Yes, export the private key option, and then click on the Next button. \nIn the third step of the Certificate Export Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the fourth step of the Certificate Export Wizard, activate the Password checkbox and enter a password in the Password and Confirm password fields. Then, click on the Next button. \nYou will use this password later when configuring the device.\nIn the fifth step of the Certificate Export Wizard, specify the file name to save the exported certificate and private key. Then, click on the Next button. \nYou can replace the previously imported file. The .pfx and .p12 extensions represent the same file format.\nIn the last step of the Certificate Export Wizard, click on the Finish button. \nDelete the temporarily imported certificate from your certificate store. \nSelect the certificate in your certificate store. \nPress the Delete key on your keyboard to delete the certificate and then click on the Yes button in the confirmation window. \nResult: You added a password to the private key of the downloaded certificate.\nConfigure the printer’s Wi-Fi connection\nIn this section, you will use HP Smart software to configure the printer for your Wi-Fi network managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nTo be able to access the printer through HP Smart and configure the connection, you must first connect to the printer directly using Wi-Fi Direct, or connect the printer to a non-secured Wi-Fi or wired network. To connect to Wi-Fi Direct, go to Step one in the HP documentation for 802.1X connections. To connect to a non-secured Wi-Fi or wired network, follow the instructions in the printer manual or go to hpsmart.com/setup.\nNote: This example is based on a HP LaserJet Pro 3002dw printer, which we connected to a secured Wi-Fi network with SSID VORLON.\nIn the HP Smart user interface, click on the Printer Settings button. \nIn the HP Smart left-hand side menu, click on the Advanced Settings option to open the Embedded Web Server in HP Smart. \nIn the Embedded Web Server’s top menu, click on the Network option. \nEnter the PIN number for the printer and click on the Submit button. \nThe PIN number is printed on a label inside the printer, in the cartridge access area.\nOn the Network page, in the left-hand side menu, select . \nConfigure the wireless network settings: \nIn the field, enter the SSID of your network. \nIn the Network Settings section, click on the WPA option, in the WPA Version field, select WPA2, and then click on the WPA-Enterprise option. \nIn the Enable Protocols section, select the EAP-TLS option, and then click on the Configure button next to the Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate label. \nIn the Install a Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate section, click on the Choose File button, select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier from Portnox Cloud, and then click on the Finish button. \nClick on the Configure button next to the Printer Certificate label. \nIn the Printer Certificate Options pane, select the Import a Certificate and Private Key option and click on the Next button. \nIn the Import a Certificate and Private Key pane, click on the Choose File button, choose the certificate that you obtained from the self-onboarding portal (the file with the added private key password), in the Password field, enter the password you chose for the private key, and then click on the Finish button. \nClick on the Apply button to apply your changes and connect to the secured Wi-Fi network. \nResult: The printer is connected to the Wi-Fi network managed by Portnox Cloud."

You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nImportant: We strongly recommend adding the URI SAN with the https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}} value, which is the device identifier. This allows Portnox Cloud to recognize situations where one device has multiple network interfaces (a Wi-Fi interface, an Ethernet interface, etc.), so that it is treated as a single device and consumes only one license. Without this attribute, agentless devices with multiple interfaces will consume separate licenses for each interface. This attribute is also used for risk assessment policies in Portnox Cloud – it lets Portnox Cloud assess the device risk and apply suitable actions.\nIn the Key storage provider (KSP) field, select the following option: Enroll to Trusted Platform Module (TPM) KSP if present, otherwise Software KSP. \nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation.

  "text": "Onboard macOS devices with certificates using Kandji and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud certificates via Kandji and SCEP to manage macOS devices (Wi-Fi only).\nKandji lets you create Wi-Fi profiles using the cloud user interface but does not let you create Ethernet profiles. If you need to create a profile with Ethernet connectivity, you need to create a custom profile manually and distribute this custom profile using Kandji. For instructions, how to do it, see the following topic: Onboard macOS devices with certificates using Kandji, SCEP, and a custom profile.\nImportant: This topic shows the configuration for macOS computers with macOS 12 (Monterey), but the Apple profile payloads Certificate, SCEP, and WiFi, which are used in this configuration, are compatible with the following Apple operating systems: iOS 4.0+, iPadOS 4.0+, macOS 10.7+, tvOS 9.0+, watchOS 3.2+. This means that you can use the same profiles to configure other Apple devices based on these operating systems, for example, iPhones.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the later step in which you get the Cloud SCEP URL and password.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nImportant: This topic shows the configuration for macOS computers with macOS 12 (Monterey), but the Apple profile payloads Certificate, SCEP, and WiFi, which are used in this configuration, are compatible with the following Apple operating systems: iOS 4.0+, iPadOS 4.0+, macOS 10.7+, tvOS 9.0+, watchOS 3.2+. This means that you can use the same profiles to configure other Apple devices based on these operating systems, for example, iPhones.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate\nIn this section, you will download the root CA certificate from Portnox™ Cloud, which is needed to create a profile.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nClick on any of the RADIUS servers listed in the right-hand pane to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link. \nResult: The root CA certificate file is in the Downloads folder on the local disk.\nDownload the tenant CA certificate\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud tenant CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nYou need the tenant CA certificate from Portnox Cloud so that your managed devices can verify the validity of individual SCEP certificates, which are signed using the tenant CA certificate.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Trusted Root Certificates section, click on the Download CER link, then save the downloaded file. \nThe default name of the file is Your_tenant_name - Portnox CLEAR.cer, for example, Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR.cer.\nOptional: Rename the downloaded file to tenantCertificate.cer. This is the name used in the next part of this guide. \nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Kandji team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Kandji to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Kandji, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nThe tenant CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, tenantCertificate.cer.\nCreate a blueprint in Kandji\nIn this section, you will create a blueprint in Kandji that lets you add Wi-Fi and wired profiles for networks as well as other Kandji security features to your managed devices.\nNote: You can skip this step if you have an existing blueprint that you want to use to organize your profiles.\nOpen your Kandji instance in the browser and log in. \nFor example, vorlon.kandji.io\nIn the Kandji main menu, click on the BLUEPRINTS option. \nKandji shows the Blueprints pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the top-right corner of the Blueprints pane, click on the New Blueprint button. \nKandji shows the Create a new Blueprint window over the right-hand pane.\nNote: You can use an existing blueprint instead. If so, skip the steps for creating a new blueprint and when asked to select a blueprint, select your existing blueprint instead.\nIn the Create a new Blueprint window, click on the + New Blueprint button in the top-left corner of the window, enter a Blueprint name, and click on the Create Blueprint button. \nWe used the name Vorlon but you can use any name you like.\nCreate a Wi-Fi profile in Kandji\nIn this section, you will create a profile that contains configuration for your managed Wi-Fi network.\nNote: You must first create a blueprint or have an existing blueprint that you will use.\nIn the Kandji main menu, click on the LIBRARY option. \nKandji shows the Library pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the top-right corner of the Library pane, click on the Add new button. \nKandji shows the Add Library item pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the Add Library item pane, in the Search box on the right-hand side, start typing wi-fi and then click on the Wi-Fi tile in the Profiles section. \nIn the Wi-Fi section on the bottom of the right-hand side pane, click on the Add & Configure button. \nKandji shows the Wi-Fi pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the Add a title field on top of the Wi-Fi Profile pane, enter the name for the new Wi-Fi profile. \nWe used the name Vorlon Wi-Fi but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Blueprint field, select the blueprint you created earlier. \nIn the section below, in the Service Set Identifier (SSID) field, enter the SSID of the Wi-Fi network configured in Portnox Cloud. \nActivate the Disable MAC address randomization checkbox. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nIn the section below: \nIn the Authentication type field, select the WPA2 Enterprise option. \nIn the Accepted EAP Types field, select the TLS option. \nIn the Identity certificate field, select the SCEP option. \nUnder the Identity certificate field, click on the Configure SCEP Certificate button. \nKandji shows the SCEP configuration pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the SCEP configuration pane on the right-hand side: \nIn the URL field, enter the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Challenge field, enter the SCEP password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Subject field, type CN=$EMAIL for user-based authentication. \nNote:\nThe $EMAIL format is a Kandji global variable. This tag is processed by Kandji and replaced by the email of the user. The full list of Kandji global variables is available in the Kandji documentation. Portnox Cloud then uses the email from the certificate fields to create or align with an account in Cloud.\nAt this time, Portnox Cloud does not support device-based authentication for Kandji. If you try to use Kandji variables related to device identifiers, Cloud will not be able to align this information with information from the authentication repository, and it will create new Portnox accounts for devices instead of aligning them with accounts from the authentication repository.\nActivate the Specify Subject Alternative Names (SAN) checkbox, in the SAN type field, select the NT Principal Name option, and in the value field, type $EMAIL. \nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field (NT Principal Name in macOS). You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nIn the Key usage field, select the Both signing and encryption option. \nAdjust values of any other fields if necessary and then click on the Done button in the bottom-right corner of the SCEP configuration pane. \nIn the section: \nActivate the Specify trusted certificates checkbox, click on the click to upload link, and select the certificate that you saved earlier (for example, the tenantCertificate.cer file). \nClick on the click to upload link again, and select the root CA certificate that you downloaded earlier (for example, the rootCertificate.cer file). \nActivate the Specify server certificate names checkbox, and in the Server certificate name field, type clear-rad.portnox.com. \nAdjust values of any other fields if necessary and then click on the Save button in the bottom-right corner of the Wi-Fi configuration pane."

For example, tenantCertificate.cer.\nCreate the custom profile\nIn this section, you will use the iMazing Profile Editor to create an Apple profile for use in Kandji, which contains the following payloads: the root CA certificate, the tenant CA certificate, the SCEP configuration, the Wi-Fi configuration, and the Global Ethernet configuration.\nNote: This guide shows the configuration on a macOS version of the iMazing Profile Editor, but you can also prepare the profile file using a Windows version of this application.\nInstall the iMazing Profile Editor and open it from the Launcher. \nTo install iMazing Profile Editor, follow the links from the iMazing website and the standard installation procedure in the operating system.\nNote: By default, when you run iMazing Profile Editor, it opens a new profile window and the General section. If not, select from the top menu to open a new profile window.\nIn the right-hand side pane, in the Name section, enter a name for this profile. \nWe used the name Vorlon SCEP but you can use any name you like.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the Root Certificate icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the file selector, locate and click on the root CA certificate file, downloaded as described in the previous section, and then click on the Open button. \nCopy the value of the Payload UUID field and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this root CA certificate in the Wi-Fi and Ethernet payloads later, so that the device can confirm the identity of the RADIUS server.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says root CA UUID.\nIn the top-right corner of the right-hand side pane, click on the + button to add another root certificate payload. \nIn the file selector, locate and click on the tenant CA certificate file, downloaded and converted as described in the previous sections, and then click on the Open button. \nCopy the value of the Payload UUID field and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this tenant CA certificate in the Wi-Fi and Ethernet payloads later, so that the device can confirm the SCEP certificate validity.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says tenant CA UUID.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the SCEP icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the SCEP pane on the right-hand side, configure the following properties: \nIn the URL section, enter the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Subject section, enter: CN={$EMAIL}. \nNote:\nThe $EMAIL format is a Kandji global variable. This tag is processed by Kandji and replaced by the email of the user. The full list of Kandji global variables is available in the Kandji documentation. Portnox Cloud then uses the email from the certificate fields to create or align with an account in Cloud.\nAt this time, Portnox Cloud does not support device-based authentication for Kandji. If you try to use Kandji variables related to device identifiers, Cloud will not be able to align this information with information from the authentication repository, and it will create new Portnox accounts for devices instead of aligning them with accounts from the authentication repository.\nIn the NT Principal Name section, enter: {$EMAIL}. \nIn the Challenge section, enter the SCEP password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nImportant: Addigy does not support special characters in passwords.\nIn the Key Size section, select the key size that you want to use. \nIn this example, we used the value 2048 but you can use 1024. Note that while higher values provide more security, they may cause certificate fragmentation problems in some network topologies. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Key Usage section, select the Both signing and encryption option. \nCopy the value in the Payload UUID and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this SCEP certificate in the Wi-Fi payload later, so that the device can confirm the SCEP certificate validity.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says SCEP UUID.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the Wi-Fi icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the Wi-Fi pane on the right-hand side, configure the following properties: \nIn the Service Set Identifier (SSID) section, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nIn the Accept EAP Types section, click on the + button, click on the added entry, and select TLS. \nIn the Password field, enter any value (this value is ignored). \nThis is necessary due to a bug in the iMazing Profile Editor. When you authenticate using TLS, the password is not used, but iMazing Profile Editor requires that you enter a password anyway.\nNote: The Wi-Fi profile has two Password sections. The one that requires a value is directly under the Accept EAP Types section.\nIn the Certificate Anchor UUID section, click on the + button twice, and in the new entry fields, paste the UUIDs that you copied earlier as root CA UUID and tenant CA UUID. \nYou need a reference to the root CA certificate so that the device can confirm that the Portnox RADIUS server is authentic, and you need a reference to the tenant CA certificate so that the device can confirm the validity of the SCEP certificate for the current user or device.\nIn the Trusted Server Certificate Names section, click on the + button and in the new entry field, type clear-rad.portnox.com. \nIn the Certificate UUID section, paste the UUID that you copied earlier as SCEP UUID. \nActivate the Disable MAC address randomization during association checkbox. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the 802.1X Ethernet: Global icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nNote: Depending on your hardware configurations, you can choose a different 802.1X Ethernet payload, for example, First Active Ethernet. The setup procedure is almost the same for all 802.1X payloads.\nIn the 802.1X Ethernet: Global pane on the right-hand side, configure the following properties: \nIn the Accept EAP Types section, click on the + button, click on the added entry, and select TLS. \nIn the Password field, enter any value (this value is ignored). \nThis is necessary due to a bug in the iMazing Profile Editor. When you authenticate using TLS, the password is not used, but iMazing Profile Editor requires that you enter a password anyway.\nIn the Certificate Anchor UUID section, click on the + button twice, and in the new entry fields, paste the UUIDs that you copied earlier as root CA UUID and tenant CA UUID. \nYou need a reference to the root CA certificate so that the device can confirm that the Portnox RADIUS server is authentic, and you need a reference to the tenant CA certificate so that the device can confirm the validity of the SCEP certificate for the current user or device.\nIn the Trusted Server Certificate Names section, click on the + button and in the new entry field, type clear-rad.portnox.com. \nIn the Interface section, select the Any Ethernet option. \nIn the top menu of iMazing Profile Editor, select , and select a location to save the profile. \nResult: The custom profile file (.mobileconfig) is saved on the disk and ready for use in Kandji.\nCreate a blueprint in Kandji\nIn this section, you will create a blueprint in Kandji that lets you add Wi-Fi and wired profiles for networks as well as other Kandji security features to your managed devices.\nNote: You can skip this step if you have an existing blueprint that you want to use to organize your profiles.\nOpen your Kandji instance in the browser and log in. \nFor example, vorlon.kandji.io\nIn the Kandji main menu, click on the BLUEPRINTS option. \nKandji shows the Blueprints pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the top-right corner of the Blueprints pane, click on the New Blueprint button. \nKandji shows the Create a new Blueprint window over the right-hand pane.\nNote: You can use an existing blueprint instead. If so, skip the steps for creating a new blueprint and when asked to select a blueprint, select your existing blueprint instead.\nIn the Create a new Blueprint window, click on the + New Blueprint button in the top-left corner of the window, enter a Blueprint name, and click on the Create Blueprint button. \nWe used the name Vorlon but you can use any name you like.\nAdd the custom profile to Kandji\nIn this section, you will upload the custom profile file to Kandji and assign it to an existing blueprint, so that Kandji can distribute it to managed devices.\nNote: You must first create a blueprint or have an existing blueprint that you will use.\nIn the Kandji main menu, click on the LIBRARY option. \nKandji shows the Library pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the top-right corner of the Library pane, click on the Add new button. \nKandji shows the Add Library item pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the Add Library item pane, in the Search box on the right-hand side, start typing profile and then click on the Custom Profile tile in the General section. \nIn the Custom Profile section on the bottom of the right-hand side pane, click on the Add & Configure button. \nKandji shows the Custom Profile pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the Add a title field on top of the Custom Profile pane, enter the name for the new custom profile. \nWe used the name Vorlon SCEP but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Blueprint field, select the blueprint you created earlier. \nIn the section below, click on the click to upload link and upload the profile file that you created in the iMazing Profile Editor. \nClick on the Save button in the bottom-right corner of the custom profile configuration pane. \nNote: If you configured an Ethernet payload for your profile, and distributed this profile to your managed devices, the first time that the user of the managed device connects to the Ethernet, they may be asked to select the connection profile (to choose between Wi-Fi and 802.1X Global Ethernet) and the certificate to use (to choose between the Kandji certificate and their SCEP certificate). This is a standard behavior for macOS and it cannot be modified by the profile."

For more information about such cases, consult Splunk documentation. Note that integration is not possible for Splunk Cloud trial accounts because the SSL/TLS certificate served on port 8088, which is required for trial accounts, is signed by an untrusted internal Splunk CA.\nImportant: Previously, the Splunk URL included a prefix http-inputs-, which is still listed in Splunk documentation, but returns a 404 error for new tenants. If you previously configured Splunk but are now facing problems with the integration, try changing the endpoint to not include http-inputs- before the tenant domain name.

In the following situations, the devices do not count for licensing purposes:\nIf the device is archived\nIf the device tried to connect but failed\nIf the device’s MAC address is added to a MAC address bypass list, but the device itself has not yet connected to the network secured by Portnox Cloud\nIf the device is manually removed by the administrator.\nFor more information about when devices consume a license, see the following FAQ entry: When does Portnox Cloud consume a license?\nIf the administrator blocks an archived device, Portnox Cloud immediately removes it."

  "text": "EAP methods and their security\nIn this topic, you will learn more about the EAP methods used by Portnox™ Cloud, authentication repositories, and operating systems.\nThe EAP framework for the 802.1X standard allows NAS devices to communicate with RADIUS servers using different protocols. Most Portnox Cloud implementations use one of three EAP methods: EAP-TTLS-PAP, EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPv2, or EAP-TLS, but there are many more methods such as EAP-PEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-LEAP, EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, and more. In this topic, we will focus on the three EAP methods (also sometimes referred to as EAP types) that are most often used with Portnox Cloud.\nEAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security)\nThe EAP-TTLS method is based on the SSL/TLS protocol and creates a secure TLS tunnel between the user device and the RADIUS server. However, the communications inside this tunnel can use several different protocols, including some of the protocols also available directly like MSCHAPv2. While ultimately the security of this communication depends on the security of the second-level protocol (also called: inner authentication), the encrypted tunnel provides protection from most attacks.\nThe two most common second-level protocols are PAP and MSCHAPv2. PAP (Password Authentication Protocol) is a basic, clear-text authentication method, while MSCHAPv2 (Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2) is a highly secure protocol with encryption and a challenge-response mechanism. For security purposes, MSCHAPv2 is a better option than PAP.\nEAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security)\nThe EAP-TLS method is fully secure and based on digital certificates. When authenticating, the RADIUS server verifies the validity of the TLS certificate installed on the client device, and then uses information from that certificate (the Subject and possibly additional information from SAN fields) to confirm the identity of the user or the device. For example, the Subject of the certificate can contain an email address or a device ID, which are then verified with the integrated repository such as Active Directory.\nWhile EAP-TLS itself is very simple, what can be regarded as complex is the creation of individual certificates on user devices. This can be done in several ways. For example, the SCEP protocol allows the user device to contact the Portnox SCEP server, send a certificate request based on a template, and get an individual certificate. This is a method used by most unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions, which automatically deploy certificates for EAP-TLS authentication on all managed machines. Another option is to use the Microsoft Server as a CA authority and have it create and distribute user and/or device certificates using GPO.\nSupport in authentication repositories\nTo be able to use a specific protocol in 802.1X communication, each entity involved in the communication must support that protocol. This includes:\nThe operating system of the client device such as a laptop or a mobile phone.\nThe NAS device such as a network switch or a Wi-Fi access point.\nThe RADIUS server responsible for authentication, for example, Portnox Cloud servers.\nThe authentication repository provider that the RADIUS server contacts to check the user credentials.\nThe weak spot of this group is usually the authentication provider. While Microsoft Active Directory supports the secure EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPv2 protocol, most cloud providers such as Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, and Okta support PAP only. And if even one of the listed entities does not support a given protocol, you cannot use this protocol for authentication.\nThis means, for example, that if your company uses cloud-based authentication in Portnox Cloud, such as the integration with Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta, you cannot use EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPv2 with accounts in these repositories. You can only use the less secure EAP-TTLS-PAP.\nFor your convenience, here is a matrix of the most popular EAP methods and their support in authentication repositories.\nEAP method Entra ID Google Workspace Okta Workforce Identity OpenLDAP Active Directory (AD) \nEAP-TLS (certificate-based)\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t\nEAP-TTLS-PAP (credentials, TLS tunnel)\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\tYes\t\nEAP-TTLS-MSCHAPv2 (credentials, encrypted, challenge-response, TLS tunnel)\t—\t—\t—\t—\tYes\t\nEAP-PEAP-MSCHAPv2 (credentials, encrypted, challenge-response, TLS tunnel)\t—\t—\t—\t—\tYes\t\nNote: Also note that Entra ID doesn’t support LDAP or secure LDAP directly. However, to achieve LDAP connectivity, you can enable an Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS) instance on your Azure AD tenant and configure network security groups through Azure Networking."

  "text": "Configure RADIUS forwarding rules\nIn this topic, you will learn how to configure forwarding rules for Cloud RADIUS servers.\nBefore you begin, you must have an active Cloud RADIUS server in Portnox Cloud. To create a Cloud RADIUS server, read the following topic: Create Cloud RADIUS servers.\nRADIUS forwarding rules let you use the Cloud RADIUS servers as your main servers, but forward selected RADIUS requests to another server. This may be useful, for example, if you want selected networks or selected domains to be handled by an independent local RADIUS server or another Cloud RADIUS server. One of the main applications of this functionality is eduroam\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nClick on the Add custom forwarding rule to add a forwarding rule. \nEach forwarding rule has two conditions (Domain name and Network name) and an action (RADIUS Server Provider). Conditions are evaluated as a logical OR – if just one of them is true, the server takes the action. The action can be either to process the request using the cloud RADIUS server that received the request originally, or to forward the request to another external RADIUS server.\nCloud RADIUS servers process the rules each time that they receive a RADIUS request from a NAS. If the request matches the first rule, Portnox Cloud follows the action that is set for that rule. If not, the process continues with the next rule. If no rule matches, the request is processed by the Cloud RADIUS server that received the request.\nSelect the condition in the Domain name field: \nIf you want this rule to apply to all domain names, select Any domain name.\nIf you want this rule to apply to specific domains only, select Custom domain name list.\nClick on the Add domain name link below. In the field that appears, enter a domain name. Click on the Add button below the field.\nIf you want this rule to apply to more domains, repeat this process by clicking on Add domain name again. If you made a mistake, click on the Remove link to the right of the domain name to remove the domain name.\nNote: The forwarding rules search for domain names in RADIUS User-Name attributes of the requests sent by the NAS to the Cloud RADIUS server.\nSelect the condition in the Network name field: \nIf you want this rule to apply to all network names, select Any network name.\nIf you want this rule to apply to specific networks names only, select Custom network name list.\nClick on the Add network name link below. In the field that appears, enter a network name. Click on the Add button below the field.\nIf you want this rule to apply to more networks, repeat this process by clicking on Add network name again. If you made a mistake, click on the Remove link to the right of the network name to remove the network name.\nNote: The forwarding rules search for network names in the Called-Station-Id attributes of the request sent by the NAS to the Cloud RADIUS server. Network names can be, for example, SSIDs.\nSelect the action in the RADIUS Server Provider field: \nIf you want this rule to keep the request for processing in the Cloud RADIUS server that originally received the request, select This Portnox Cloud tenant will service these requests.\nIf you want this rule to forward the request to another RADIUS server, select Forward RADIUS authentication requests to another Portnox Cloud tenant or to an external RADIUS server.\nClick on the Add another RADIUS server button to add a server definition.\nEnter relevant parameters for the RADIUS server to forward the requests to: Target Host, Target Authentication Port, Target Accounting Port, and the Shared Secret.\nNote: Each rule can define a different external RADIUS server, but all these servers must be available on a public interface. You cannot forward the request to one of the two Cloud RADIUS servers or you risk creating an endless loop if the same server originally receives the request.\nAdd more servers if needed (up to three).\nNote: You can have up to three defined target servers. Authentication requests are forwarded to the first server in priority order. If there is no response for 30 seconds from a server, that server is marked as dead​, and then the next server is used for subsequent authentication attempts​. If all servers are marked as dead, then the last server will be used. A server is marked live again after 2 minutes automatically. There are no retries unless configured on the NAS device.\nOptional: Configure settings in the Additional settings section: \nActivate the Add Stripped-User-Name attribute checkbox, if you want the Cloud RADIUS servers to add the Stripped-User-Name attribute to the forwarded request. This attribute contains the user identifier without delimiters and domain names, and may be required by some RADIUS servers.\nActivate the Assign to a specific VLAN checkbox, if you want the Cloud RADIUS servers to forward the request and suggest a specific vlan using the Tunnel-Private-Group-ID attribute. Enter the VLAN name in the VLAN field.\nClick on the Save button to save your changes or click on the Cancel button to abandon all changes. \nAfter you click on one of the buttons, Portnox Cloud will exit the edit mode.\nTo add more rules, repeat the above process by clicking on the Add custom forwarding rule link. \nTo edit an existing rule, click on the Edit link next to the rule. \nThe editing process is identical to creating a new rule.\nTo remove an existing rule, click on the Remove link next to the rule."

Every new user that logs in to the computer must onboard AgentP manually.\nThis is the default running mode if at least one of the following conditions is true:\nThe device uses an operating system other than Windows.\nPortnox Cloud is integrated with an authentication repository other than Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory.\nYour tenant was created before March 18, 2024, and you did not turn on the Install computer certificate option.\nMulti-user mode: In this mode, AgentP recognizes the identity of the user who is currently logged in to the computer, and authenticates that user with the network. If the user logs out and another user logs in, AgentP identifies the newly logged in user.\nThis is the default running mode if all of the following conditions are true:\nThe device uses Windows 10 or later.\nPortnox Cloud is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory as the authentication repository.\nYour tenant was created after March 18, 2024, or you manually turned on the Install computer certificate option.\nKiosk mode: In this mode, AgentP does not identify any users, but identifies the device only.

The user is automatically onboarded on the basis of their Entra ID or Active Directory account. This mode is not available for other repositories.\nTo learn how to install AgentP in unattended mode, see the following topic: Onboard Windows devices with AgentP in unattended or kiosk mode."

  "text": "AgentP and certificates\nIn this topic, you will learn what certificates AgentP installs on Windows computers in its different operating modes.\nWhat is the computer certificate store and the user certificate store?\nThere are two places where a Windows system stores certificates: the computer certificate store (managed using the Manage computer certificates control panel) and the user certificate store (managed using the Manage user certificates control panel). The computer certificate store is accessible as soon as the operating system is running, even when there is no logged-in user. The user certificate store is accessible for the specific logged-in user. For example, if the user kosh is logged in, neither this user nor the operating system can access the certificates in the user certificate store that belongs to the user ulkesh, or the other way around.\nThis gives two ways of authenticating the endpoint on a network. A certificate from the computer store guarantees that this is a specific device (for example, a company device). A certificate from the user store guarantees that a specific user is logged on to this device and lets you adjust network access depending on the privileges of that user.\nWhat are computer certificates and user certificates?\nIn addition to the two different certificate stores, there are also two common names used to describe the types of certificates: user certificates and computer certificates (or device certificates). These names apply not to the store where the certificate is located, but rather to the information that is in the certificate.\nFor example, a user certificate may have the user’s email address in the Subject field, or in one of the SAN (Subject Alternative Name) fields, such as the email field. This way, the application or system that checks this certificate can verify that this is a certificate that was issued for this specific user.\nOn the other hand, a computer/device certificate may have the device ID or another unique identifier of the device in the Subject field or one of the SAN fields, such as the Distinguished Name. This way, the application or system that checks this certificate can verify that this certificate was issued for the specific device, and not an individual user.\nNote: While the computer certificate store is primarily for computer certificates, and the user certificate store is for user certificates, there is no limitation as to the types of certificates in each store. You can have user certificates in the computer store and computer certificates in the user store.\nHow does AgentP use computer and user certificates?\nOn Windows, AgentP can run in one of three operating modes:\nSingle-user mode: Network access will be based on user certificates only (from the user store and the computer store) because no computer certificates are available. This means that when the user logs out, the computer maintains access to the network with the credentials of the last user that was logged in (using the certificate of that user).\nNote: This is the default mode if Portnox Cloud uses a repository that doesn’t support computer accounts (such as Google Workspace and Okta Workforce Identity), or if your tenant was created before March 18, 2024 (see below) or you turned off the Install computer certificate option.\nExample: The tenant Vorlon is integrated with Google Workspace.\nThe user Kosh (kosh@vorlon.com) logs in to the computer (for the first time).\nKosh has no access to the secure network, so he connects to a guest SSID.\nKosh onboards AgentP using their Google Workspace credentials.\nAgentP installs Kosh’s user certificate.\nThe computer now has secure network access with Kosh’s privileges.\nKosh logs out of the computer. The computer, in the background, still has secure network access with Kosh’s privileges (using his user certificate from the computer store).\nThe user Ulkesh (ulkesh@vorlon.com) logs in to the same computer (for the first time). \nUlkesh has no access to the secure network, so he connects to a guest SSID.\nUlkesh onboards AgentP using their Google Workspace credentials.\nAgentP installs Ulkesh’s user certificate.\nThe computer now has secure network access with Ulkesh’s privileges.\nUlkesh logs out of the computer. The computer still has network access in the background with Ulkesh’s privileges (using his user certificate from the computer store).\nMulti-user mode: Network access will be based on the user certificate of the logged-in user (from the user store), and when no user is logged in, on the computer certificate (from the computer store).\nMulti-user mode only applies when AgentP is installed in unattended (auto-enroll) scenarios. Enabling multi-user does not alter certificate distribution or impact devices already enrolled in single-user mode. Existing single-user devices continue to function as before, while new or reactivated devices can take advantage of multi-user behavior.\nNote: This is the default mode if Portnox Cloud uses a repository that integrates with the Windows operating system (Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory), and the tenant was created after March 18, 2024 or you turned on the Install computer certificate option (see below).\nExample: The tenant Vorlon is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.\nThe user Kosh (kosh@vorlon.com) logs in to the computer with their Entra ID credentials. \nAgentP uses the Kosh’s user certificate from the user store to authorize with the network.\nThe computer now has secure network access with Kosh’s privileges.\nKosh logs out of the computer. The computer still has network access in the background with privileges based on the computer certificate.\nThe user Ulkesh (ulkesh@vorlon.com) logs in to the same computer with their Entra ID credentials. \nAgentP uses the Ulkesh’s user certificate from the user store to authorize with the network.\nThe computer now has secure network access with Ulkesh’s privileges.\nUlkesh logs out of the computer. The computer still has network access in the background with privileges based on the computer certificate installed earlier.\nImportant:\nDue to the way Windows handles certificates in the user store and the computer store, a Windows device cannot use the device certificate from the computer store when a user is logged in. This means that if a new user logs in to the device for the first time ever and wants to onboard with AgentP, the device has no certificate to authorize this new user with the network.\nThere are two workarounds to this problem:\nOption 1: Quarantine VLAN\nCreate a quarantine VLAN on the NAS device and configure Portnox Cloud so that users who fail network authentication still have access to the Internet, or only to specific FQDNs, as listed here: How to set up the firewall for AgentP to connect to Cloud.\nAsk the new user to try to connect to the corporate network on the device. The device will be placed in this quarantine VLAN, but AgentP will have access to the Internet or to Portnox Cloud servers only, so it will be able to onboard the new user.\nAfter AgentP is onboarded, ask the new user to disconnect from the corporate network and connect again. The device now has the user certificate, so it will authenticate with the network and will no longer be placed in the quarantine VLAN.\nOption 2: Guest network\nAsk the new user to connect to the company guest network. AgentP will have access to the Internet, so it will be able to onboard the new user.\nAfter AgentP is onboarded, ask the new user to disconnect from the guest network and connect to the corporate network. The device now has the user certificate, so it will authenticate with the network.\nKiosk mode: Network access will be based only on the certificate from the computer store. Certificates in the user stores will be ignored.\nNote: This mode must be activated manually. It is only available if Portnox Cloud uses a repository that supports computer accounts (Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory)\nExample: The tenant Vorlon is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.\nThe computer Sigma957 is a kiosk computer. \nThe administrator logs in to the computer with the administrator account, installs AgentP, and onboards it using their own Entra ID credentials.\nAgentP installs the administrator’s user certificate in the user store and the computer’s (sigma957.vorlon.com) certificate in the computer store.\nThe administrator switches AgentP to kiosk mode and logs out of the computer. Since the administrator is logged out, their user certificate is no longer accessible.\nThe administrator logs in the local kiosk account.\nSigma937 now has network access with privileges based on the computer certificate installed earlier.\nWhat certificates does AgentP install?\nIndependent on which mode you choose, AgentP prepares the computer for all operating modes and installs certificates in the computer store and the user store:\nIf you created your tenant on March 18, 2024 or later or you turned on the Install computer certificate option, and if your tenant is integrated with Active Directory or Entra ID, AgentP installs the following certificates:\nA user certificate in the user certificate store. If AgentP is running in the single-user mode, it installs this certificate only once, during enrollment. If AgentP is running in the multi-user mode, it installs the current user’s certificate in the user store every time a new user logs in. If AgentP is running in the kiosk mode, it installs this certificate during enrollment but never uses it.\nA computer certificate in the computer certificate store. This certificate can be used in multi-user mode by the network adapter when no user is logged in to maintain Internet access so that AgentP can connect to the Portnox Cloud when another user logs in and obtain information necessary to onboard that user.\nIf you created your tenant on March 17, 2024 or earlier, if you turned off the or you turned on the Install computer certificate option, or if your tenant is integrated with non-Microsoft authentication repositories, AgentP installs the following certificates:\nA user certificate in the user certificate store. If AgentP is running in the single-user mode, it installs this certificate only once, during enrollment. If AgentP is running in the multi-user mode, it installs the current user’s certificate in the user store every time a new user logs in. If AgentP is running in the kiosk mode, it installs this certificate during enrollment but never uses it.\nThe currently logged-in user’s certificate in the computer certificate store. This certificate can be used in multi-user mode by the network adapter when no user is logged in to maintain Internet access so that AgentP can connect to the Portnox Cloud when another user logs in and obtain information necessary to onboard that user.\nWhat is the 802.1X authentication mode setting?\nWhen you configure a group in Portnox Cloud, you come across a setting called 802.1X authentication mode :\nThese options let you decide how AgentP configures the network adapter when connecting to the secure network:\nComputer authentication only: AgentP configures the network adapter to always use the certificate from the computer store. This means that the network adapter will use the same certificate when there is no logged-in user, and when a user is logged in, independent of what user is logged in.\nUser authentication only: AgentP configures the network adapter to use the certificate from the user store only. This means that when there is no logged-in user, the computer will not be able to access the networks protected by Portnox Cloud. When a user is logged in, the network adapter will use the certificate of the logged-in user. This setting should only be used for dedicated company devices used by one person only.\nUser or computer authentication (Recommended): AgentP configures the network adapter to use the certificate from the computer store when there is no logged-in user, and a certificate from the user store when a user is logged in. You can also use this setting for personal devices and for kiosk devices. This lets you switch between different modes of operation without the need to reconfigure Portnox Cloud.\nNote: AgentP installs the certificates described above independent on this setting. Even if you, for example, select Computer authentication only, AgentP will still install a user certificate in the user certificate store when you enroll. It will simply not use that certificate when configuring the network adapter."

  "text": "Portnox Cloud best practices\nAuthentication repositories\nShould I use manual or automatic provisioning for an authentication repository?\nMost of our customers use automatic provisioning. We recommend starting with automatic provisioning. If it does not meet your requirements, you can remove it and switch to manual provisioning.\nThe choice between automatic and manual provisioning is available only for the Entra ID authentication repository. For Google Workspace, only automatic provisioning is supported, while Okta always requires manual provisioning using the REST API or LDAP.\nCan I use a hybrid configuration with Active Directory and Entra ID?\nYes, you can configure Portnox Cloud to work with both Entra ID and Active Directory. However, by default, Entra ID takes precedence. Users and devices found in Entra ID bypass synchronization with on-premises AD.\nIf you use AgentP with unattended enrollment, you can override this behavior by enabling the option to prefer on-premises AD over Entra ID.\nHow many Portnox LDAP Brokers should I use?\nWe recommend deploying at least two Portnox LDAP Brokers if you use Portnox Cloud with Active Directory or an on-premises LDAP directory. If an LDAP Broker becomes unavailable for any reason, you will lose the ability to authenticate on the network and more. The LDAP Broker is lightweight and easy to deploy.\nHow do I deploy LDAP Broker securely?\nWe strongly recommend treating LDAP Broker as a Tier 0 application because it requires high-level permissions in the local AD or LDAP directory to function. A compromise of the LDAP Broker could give an attacker full control over your local directory.\nCloud RADIUS and local RADIUS\nShould I use only Cloud RADIUS servers or local RADIUS?\nWe recommend a hybrid setup, which is used by most of our customers: deploy local RADIUS servers, configure them as the primary servers on your NAS devices, and optionally configure Cloud RADIUS servers as secondary servers. While it is possible to configure Cloud RADIUS as primary servers, this can slow response times, especially during outages, because the NAS will first attempt to contact the Cloud and only switch to the local RADIUS if the Cloud is unreachable.\nIf you configure only Cloud RADIUS servers, an Internet outage will prevent local users from logging in to the local network. We recommend this approach only if you have no local resources (i.e., all resources are cloud-based) and your local network exists solely to provide Internet access.\nHow many local RADIUS servers should I use?\nWe recommend deploying at least two local RADIUS servers. They are inexpensive to run, and having multiple servers ensures redundancy if one fails.\nThe number of local RADIUS servers depends on the capabilities of your NAS devices. Some NAS devices limit the number of RADIUS servers you can configure. If you also configure Cloud RADIUS servers, they may take available configuration slots, reducing the number available for local RADIUS servers.\nShould I run a local RADIUS server in a VM or Docker?\nWe recommend running local RADIUS servers in Docker because it is easier to set up and uses fewer machine resources.\nThe advantage of virtual machines is that the local RADIUS server is updated automatically. To enable automatic updates for a Docker-based local RADIUS server, you need to deploy the portnox-autoupdate Docker container.\nIf you prefer using virtual machines, for example, due to network or firewall configurations, the local RADIUS server can run on all major virtual machine platforms.\nDoes it make sense to run a local RADIUS server in a cloud service?\nWhile it is possible to configure a local RADIUS server in a cloud service (and we provide instructions on how to do this on Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud), we recommend running the local RADIUS server on-premises only, as most of our customers do. Its primary purpose is to provide connectivity during Internet outages, and placing it in a cloud service would make it inaccessible during such outages.\nIf your goal is to enhance security by running a local RADIUS server in the cloud, this is unnecessary. The local RADIUS server connects to Portnox Cloud using fully secure TLS communications, and you can also configure Cloud RADIUS with RadSec to ensure fully encrypted RADIUS communication.\nShould I use RadSec if it is available on my NAS device, or is RADIUS secure enough?\nMost of our customers use RADIUS without RadSec. The RADIUS protocol supports different authentication methods. The methods we recommend (see below), such as EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS, are fully secure even without RadSec because they never transmit credentials in plain text.\nIf you must use credential-based authentication with a less secure method such as PEAP, for example, if your authentication repository does not support stronger methods and you prefer not to use certificates, we recommend configuring RadSec to prevent credential leakage through man-in-the-middle attacks.\nRegardless of the EAP methods used, if your devices support RadSec, the only drawback is increased configuration complexity. This is especially true for RadSec mutual authentication, which requires uploading the device’s root certificate to Portnox Cloud.\nAuthentication methods\nShould I use certificates, credentials, or MAC-based authentication?\nWe strongly recommend using certificates for authentication (the EAP-TLS method for RADIUS/802.1X). Certificates are supported on all major platforms, provide a much higher level of security than credentials, and are compatible with all authentication repositories.\nIf you must use credentials, be aware that many authentication repositories do not support highly secure credential exchange. For example, Google Workspace requires users to create individual app passwords for credential-based authentication, which makes onboarding time-consuming and complex. Entra ID only supports EAP-TTLS, which is less secure than PEAP-MSCHAPv2 supported by on-premises directories such as Active Directory. Therefore, credentials should be used only when absolutely necessary, and preferably only with on-premises authentication repositories.\nMAC-based authentication should be treated as a last resort, only for devices that do not support other methods, such as some IoT devices. It is not fully secure because MAC addresses can be spoofed. While Portnox Cloud provides MAC spoofing detection, MAC-based authentication remains less secure than using certificates or credentials.\nShould I use user certificates or device certificates?\nYour choice depends on how your devices are used. For mostly individual devices or devices that support user accounts and are shared among multiple users, we recommend using user-based certificates for authentication.\nFor devices that do not support user accounts, such as kiosks, scanners, and similar devices, device-based certificates are preferable, as you cannot identify the individual using the device.\nDevice authentication is available only with Entra ID, Active Directory, or on-premises LDAP directories. Google Workspace and Okta do not support device accounts. If you want to use device-based authentication with Google Workspace or Okta, Portnox Cloud must create local Portnox accounts for the devices, requiring you to manage these devices directly in Portnox Cloud instead of your usual authentication repository.\nShould I use Portnox certificates or my own certificate authority?\nWe strongly recommend using the certificate authority provided by Portnox Cloud for ease of configuration. While Portnox Cloud allows you to upload your own CA certificate and issue certificates to users and devices, this places the entire certificate management process on you. Portnox Cloud cannot directly use your CA; it can only verify whether the certificates presented by devices are valid. You are then responsible for managing all device configuration processes and certificate issuance, including providing your own SCEP server or alternative methods to distribute certificates to all devices.\nAgent-based and agentless onboarding\nShould I use AgentP or can I authenticate and configure my devices without it?\nMost customers use AgentP because it simplifies device configuration and provides additional benefits, such as risk assessment. We highly recommend using AgentP.\nIf you already use a Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform, such as Intune, Jamf, or others, you can obtain certificates from Portnox Cloud via the SCEP protocol and deliver them to devices, as well as configure device interfaces to use these certificates. However, this process is more complex than using AgentP, and while many UEM platforms have been tested, not all fully support SCEP.\nIf you want to use risk assessment without AgentP, you must use Intune or Jamf. These are the supported platforms for providing risk assessment information to Portnox Cloud. You can also assess risk using other supported platforms, such as SentinelOne, which works together with Intune to deliver risk information to Portnox Cloud, enabling you to decide whether to limit network access when risk levels are high.\nShould I use single-user, multi-user, or device onboarding with AgentP?\nIf the device supports multiple users, for example, a Windows desktop used by several employees, such as a reception computer, use multi-user onboarding with AgentP. This allows Portnox Cloud to assign different certificates and access rights for each user (user authentication) and separate certificates and access rights when no user is logged on (computer authentication). Note that this requires Windows integrated with Entra ID or Active Directory.\nIf the device is a personal device used by a single user, such as a personal laptop, use single-user authentication. The device will always retain the access rights of that user.\nIf the device is not tied to any users, such as a self-service kiosk, use device-based authentication because the actual user cannot be identified.\nShould I distribute AgentP to all the machines in my networks?\nWe recommend distributing AgentP using your existing UEM/MDM software, such as Intune or Jamf, just as you use these platforms to manage other applications on users' devices. If you use Windows with Entra ID or Active Directory, the user onboarding process is fully automated because AgentP can retrieve user information directly from the operating system integrated with the same authentication repository. For other repositories and operating systems, users must manually log in to the authentication repository to start using AgentP.\nIf automatic distribution is not possible, or if users have BYOD devices, they can download AgentP directly from the web or app stores, install it easily, and log in to the authentication repository to get AgentP fully operational in under a minute.\nNetwork device configuration\nShould I configure NAS devices in any special way to work best with Portnox Cloud?\nWe strongly recommend checking whether your device supports a feature often called critical authentication or critical VLAN, and configuring it if available. Refer to your device manual to determine support and setup instructions. This feature allows users to connect to the local network even during a RADIUS failure, such as an Internet outage (if no local RADIUS is configured) or a local RADIUS outage (especially if only one local RADIUS is used). Essentially, if the device cannot reach any configured RADIUS servers, it will still allow user connections to the local network but assign them to a special VLAN with limited privileges.\nWe strongly recommend using the Portnox Cloud monitoring mode when testing new NAS device configurations. Monitoring mode does not lock anyone out of the network, but lets you observe connections to ensure correct setup. After monitoring user behavior for a short period, you can disable monitoring mode.\nPortnox groups and policies\nWhat is the best way to set up Portnox groups?\nWe strongly recommend keeping the Default group as a catch-all or radar group. Configure this group with minimal access rights (for example, only Internet access and no local resources) and allow any authenticated devices or users to initially connect here. Periodically review who ends up in this group and assign them to higher-access groups as needed. Especially during testing or early onboarding, this approach simplifies deployment and accelerates onboarding.\nCreate only the minimum number of groups required with different privileges. While having more groups does not negatively affect Portnox Cloud performance, it increases management complexity, making mistakes and troubleshooting more likely.\nWhat is the best way to set up Portnox policies and sites?\nWe strongly recommend keeping the number of policies to a minimum. Although many policies do not impact Portnox Cloud performance, they increase management complexity and the risk of human error.\nUse sites only when necessary, primarily for site-level identification in alerts or troubleshooting. Adding sites increases management complexity and the likelihood of mistakes.\nMigration\nWhat is the best way to migrate from the current network setup to a setup based on Portnox Cloud?\nWhen migrating Wi-Fi connections, we strongly recommend creating a parallel SSID: \nKeep the legacy SSID active while introducing a new 802.1X-secured SSID.\nPush new SSID profiles to managed devices via AgentP, UEM/MDM software, or GPO.\nThis approach provides a safe runway for testing before retiring the old SSID. \nIf absolutely necessary, you can reuse the existing SSID while changing its authentication method to Portnox RADIUS. This requires all devices to be pre-provisioned with certificates and proper configurations, for example, using AgentP, UEM/MDM software, or GPO. Note that this approach carries a higher risk of service disruption. We strongly recommend keeping a fallback SSID available during cutover.\nWhat is the best-practices migration process?\nPlanning\nInventory current SSIDs, VLANs, ACLs, DHCP scopes, etc.\nDocument any existing authentication methods and segmentation policies.\nDefine migration goals (e.g., move to certificate-based authentication).\nLab testing and pilot roll-out\nCreate a test SSID using the Cloud RADIUS.\nValidate authentication and connectivity across required device types (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, IoT).\nConfirm correct VLAN assignment and fallback behavior during RADIUS downtime.\nEnsure that the monitoring mode is enabled on NAS devices to log issues without blocking access.\nStart with IT staff or early adopters.\nUse the Devices page and Alerts in Portnox Cloud to monitor authentication results.\nStaged deployment\nOnce comfortable with the testing, expand the migration department-by-department or site-by-site.\nEnsure all managed devices have AgentP installed or the necessary SCEP profiles pushed from UEM/MDM software before cutting over.\nIf the devices aren’t using certificates, ensure the necessary MAC addresses are whitelisted in Portnox.\nValidation\nConfirm RADIUS responses and redundancy.\nValidate certificate delivery workflows (AgentP, SCEP, UEM/MDM).\nCheck that the correct VLANs and policies are applied per group.\nLegacy SSID retirement\nDisable old SSIDs only after confirming full coverage.\nEnsure fallback/quarantine VLAN exists for stragglers, if necessary.\nPost-migration cleanup\nTurn off the monitoring mode for all NAS devices gradually.\nRemove obsolete SSIDs and unused configurations.\nAudit NAS devices for consistency.\nUpdate any internal documentation to reflect the new SSID structure and Portnox policies."

The entire communication is strongly secured.\nIf you use SSH to connect to the TACACS+ device, your credentials are fully encrypted end-to-end. First through the SSH session, then through the TACACS+ protocol to the TACACS+ virtual appliance or the Docker container, and then finally though the encrypted TLS tunnel between the TACACS+ virtual appliance or Docker container to Portnox Cloud.\nCommunication between the TACACS+ server and Portnox Cloud involves sending the credentials because they are necessary to validate the user’s authentication against their selected authentication repository. These credentials are always encrypted and never stored or persisted anywhere in the chain."

  "text": "Deploy the local RADIUS server container in Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local RADIUS server container in Amazon Web Services (AWS) using AWS Fargate.\nTo deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container in AWS Container Instances, you must first configure the settings for the local RADIUS server container and generate environment variables. To do it, go to the following topic: Run the local RADIUS server in a container.\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nAWS Fargate is one of the options to deploy the local RADIUS server container in AWS. Other options include using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or EC2 instances. If you choose a different option, please follow the relevant AWS documentation for your chosen method.\nIn order for the local RADIUS server container in AWS to be able to communicate with your NAS devices in your local network, you must create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS and connect it to your local network. AWS offers many ways of achieving this. This topic is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find useful information in the following AWS documentation topic: Connect your VPC to remote networks using AWS Virtual Private Network.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local RADIUS server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nWhen you’re using stateless containers and you want to update to a newer version of the Docker image, you need to delete the container and recreate it from scratch with the same parameters.\nCreate a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nIn this section, you will create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a private subnet for local RADIUS server containers.\nNote: You can skip this section if you already have a Virtual Private Cloud with a subnet that you want to dedicate to your local RADIUS server containers and relevant configuration. You can also add a new subnet to an existing VPC manually.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the VPC dashboard pane, click on the Create VPC button to begin creating the VPC. \nIn the VPC settings section, select the VPC and more option. \nIn the Name tag auto-generation section, activate the Auto-generate checkbox and enter a prefix in the text field below. \nIn this example, we used the prefix portnox, but you can use any prefix you like.\nIn the IPv4 CIDR block field, enter the IPv4 CIDR block for your private network. \nIn this example, we used the 10.1.0.0/16 private network block but you can use any block you like. The default block offered by AWS is 10.0.0.0/16.\nIn the Number of Availability Zones (AZs) field, select 1. \nIn the Number of public subnets field, select 1 and in the Number of private subnets field, select 1. \nNote: You need the public subnet in AWS to connect the local RADIUS server to the internet.\nIn the NAT gateways field, select the In 1 AZoption. \nIn the VPC endpoints field, select the None option. \nActivate the checkboxes: Enable DNS hostnames and Enable DNS resolution. \nClick on the Create VPC button below to create the VPC. \nCreate a task definition and a cluster\nIn this section, you will deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container to the Virtual Private Cloud created in the previous step by creating a task definition and a cluster.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click on the Task definitions option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create new task definition button. \nIn the Create new task definition pane, in the Task definition family field, enter a name for your task definition. \nIn this example, we used the task name RADIUS but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Infrastructure requirements section, in the Launch type field, select the AWS Fargate option and in the Operating system/Architecture field, select the Linux/X86_64 option. \nIn the section, in the Name field, enter a name for the container, and in the Image URI field, enter portnox/portnox-radius:latest. \nIn this example, we used the container name radius but you can use any name you like.\nIn the section, click on the Add environment variable button three times to add three environment variables. Then, copy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three Key and Value pairs. \nOptional: If you want to store the RADIUS_GATEWAY_TOKEN value safely as a secret, you can use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: \nIn another browser tab, in the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand menu of the Systems Manager pane, select the option. \nClick on the Create parameter button. \nIn the Create parameter pane, in the Name field, enter a name for your parameter, for example radius_gateway_token. \nIn the Value field, paste the value of the token copied from Portnox Cloud. \nClick on the Create parameter button below. \nGo back to the task definition tab, and in the relevant environment variable, as the value enter ssm:/radius_gateway_token. \nScroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Create button. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click on the Clusters option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create cluster option. \nIn the Cluster name field, enter a name for your cluster, and in the Infrastructure section, select the AWS Fargate option. Then, click on the Create button below. \nIn this example, we used the cluster Portnox but you can use any name you like.\nAfter your cluster has been created successfully, in the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click again on the Task definitions option. \nIn the Task definitions pane, click on the name of the task definition you created earlier, and then click on the latest revision in the list of revisions. \nClick on the Deploy button in the top-right corner, and select the Run task option. \nIn the Create pane, in the Existing cluster field, select the cluster that you just created. \nScroll down to the Networking section and click on the heading to show the section. In the VPC field, select the virtual private cloud that you created earlier, in the Subnets field, select the subnets that you created together with the VPC, and in the Public IP section, turn the switch off. \nScroll all the way down and click on the Create button. \nAfter the deployment is complete, note down the Private IP address of the server. \nResult: Your local RADIUS server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nCreate a private hosted DNS zone\nIn this section, you will create a private hosted DNS zone for your Virtual Private Cloud, which lets you configure your NAS devices to access the local RADIUS server using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of its IP address.\nEvery time that you stop and restart your local RADIUS server container in AWS, it may be assigned a different IP address on the subnet, which means you would have to reconfigure your NAS devices after every restart. Unfortunately, at this time, AWS does not offer any method to maintain a fixed IP address on its virtual private cloud.\nTo overcome this problem, you can configure a private hosted DNS zone in AWS, assign a private FQDN to the local RADIUS server, and configure the NAS devices to access this server using this FQDN. This way, if you need to restart the container and get a different IP address, you can just change the IP address in the zone definition instead of having to reconfigure every NAS device.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Route 53 pane, click on the Hosted zones option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create hosted zone button. \nIn the Create hosted zone pane, in the Domain name, enter the local domain name that you want to use and in the Type section, click on the Private hosted zone option. \nIn this example, we used the domain vorlon.local but you can use any domain you like.\nIn the VPCs to associate with the hosted zone section, in the Region field, select the region in which you created your VPC earlier, and in the VPC ID field, select your VPC ID from the list. \nThen, click on the Create hosted zone button below to create the hosted zone. \nIn the pane that represents your newly created hosted zone, in the Records section, click on the Create record button. \nIn the Create record pane, in the Record name field, enter the name that you want to use for your local RADIUS server host, in the Record type field, select the A – Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources option, and in the Value field, enter the IP address of your deployed local RADIUS server container that you noted down in the previous task. \nIn this example, we used the radius record name to create a radius.vorlon.local record but you can use any record name you like.\nNote: If you didn’t note down the IP address earlier, open a new browser tab and check the address by going to \nThen, click on the Create records button below. \nResult: You can configure your NAS devices in the VPC to access the local RADIUS server using its FQDN (in our example, radius.vorlon.local) in the VPC instead of its IP address (in our example, 10.1.136.187). You also need to configure the resolver in the NAS device to use one of the AWS DNS servers listed in the NS record, in the Value field.\nIf you need to restart the container and the IP address of the local RADIUS server changes, change the IP address in the record that you created for your hosted zone."

  "text": "Integrating with SIEM platforms\nIn this section, you will learn about the options that are available in Cloud to integrate it with SIEM solution. These options may help you integrate Cloud with software that is not specifically described in our list (both cloud solutions and on-premises solutions).\nTo access the configuration for integration with SIEM solutions, click on: \nThen, click on the Add new SIEM link to create a new SIEM integration configuration.\nBelow is the explanation of the available options and their potential use.\nIntegration type: Select the type/brand of SIEM software that you want to integrate with. \nCustom: Select this option for all SIEM software other than the specific ones listed in this option.\nNamed options: Select an option for a specific SIEM type that requires a different integration. For example, select Datadog to integrate with Datadog SIEM.\nName: Enter a unique name for this integration configuration. \nStatus: Use this option only if you need to temporarily disable the integration and you do not want to delete the entire configuration. \nDisabled: If you select this option, this integration will be disabled.\nEnabled: If you select this option, this integration will be active.\nProtocol type: Select the protocol that will be used by Cloud to send events to the SIEM solution. \nThe most common method used to send events to SIEM solution is the syslog client-server architecture. This architecture describes the format of the log messages, but they can be sent to the syslog server over different protocols.\nSyslog over TCP: The messages in syslog format are sent using the TCP protocol. This requires the syslog server to be listening on an open TCP port. Note that the messages are sent in clear text and can be intercepted.\nSyslog over UDP: The messages in syslog format are sent using the UDP protocol. This requires the syslog server to be listening on an open UDP port. Note that the messages are sent in clear text and can be intercepted.\nSyslog over TLS: The messages in syslog format are sent using a TLS tunnel. This requires a TLS tunnel to be established between the client and the server. Messages are then sent encrypted and cannot be intercepted.\nHTTPS: The events are sent using an HTTPS connection. This requires an HTTPS collector listening for messages. This is a common option in cloud-based SIEM solutions such as Splunk or Sumo Logic.\nImportant: In some cases, the SIEM platform does not provide a syslog server and you may need a third-party syslog server that acts as temporary log storage. You can set up such a server, for example, in an Azure cloud or on-premises. In such cases, Cloud sends the events to the cloud syslog server, and your SIEM solution picks them up from the syslog server.\nIP: The IP address that Cloud sends events to. \nFor direct communication, this must be an external IP address that Cloud can connect to. If you need to configure the firewall to restrict this access to specific IPs, use the following IP addresses: 23.97.155.157, 52.168.164.222, 20.72.156.111, and 51.124.144.69.\nPort: The port number that Cloud sends events to. \nCommunication method: Decides how Cloud is to send events to the SIEM solution. \nDirect: Cloud will send direct messages to an external, public IP address and port as configured. You can use this method, if your cloud solution has an open port to receive messages in your cloud tenant, if your cloud solution uses a HTTPS log collector, if you have a syslog server in a public cloud such as Azure, or if you have an on-premises syslog server that listens on a public IP and port.\nVia Portnox Cloud Directory Broker: Use an on-premises Portnox LDAP Broker to collect the messages from Portnox Cloud and send them locally to your on-premises solution. In such case, the IP address and port that you specify above are the local IP address and port accessible from the machine running LDAP Broker.\nVia Docker image: portnox-siem: Use an on-premises portnox-siem Docker image to collect the messages from Portnox cloud and send them locally to your on-premises solution. In such case, the IP address and port that you specify above are the local IP address and port accessible from the machine running the Docker image.\nBy using Portnox LDAP Broker or the Docker image, you can avoid the need to have a public IP address and port to collect the logs. You can set up your syslog collector on a local machine, set up the Docker image or LDAP Broker on the same or another machine in the same local network, and then the Docker image or LDAP Broker will poll Portnox Cloud to obtain new messages and send these messages locally to your local network syslog server.\nNote: Portnox LDAP Broker requires Active Directory on-premises, and you need to integrate Cloud with Active Directory. The Docker image has no such requirements, and is therefore a better choice in most environments.\nData format: What format should the Cloud events be sent in. \nJSON: The JSON format is almost exclusively used with HTTPS collectors (see the Protocol type field).\nCEF: The CEF format (Common Event Format) is used as an extension of the syslog format to allow for sending security messages to SIEM software. If you collect data using syslog, you will most probably need to select this option.\nAlert notification interval (minutes): Specifies how often events are to be sent from Portnox Cloud to your SIEM software. \nHealth check interval (minutes): Specifies how often Portnox Cloud sends health check messages to your SIEM software, if there are no new events to send. \nUnmerge alerts: Portnox Cloud merges some alerts into a single alert for convenience. If you would rather receive every alert separately, activate this checkbox."

Therefore, when viewing the device in the device grid, AgentP devices have the most information available, and this information persists even if AgentP was uninstalled. Similar information may also be provided through LDAP fields for the device in case of LDAP-based onboarding.\nAdditionally, when any device connects to the network protected by Portnox Cloud, Cloud attempts to automatically recognize the device make/model on the basis of two mechanisms:\nMAC addresses: The first three bytes of the MAC address are called the vendor address component and they uniquely identify the vendor of the equipment. The last three bytes are used by every vendor differently. Portnox uses its own proprietary method of examining MAC addresses that is called MAC address clustering, which not only gives information about the vendor but also lets Portnox identify the make and model of the device.\nNote: Many devices allow you to spoof the MAC address, for example, you can easily change the MAC address of any network adapter on a Windows computer. The spoofed address may specify another vendor and another device type. Therefore, MAC address information is not fully reliable.\nDHCP fingerprinting: Portnox Cloud uses DHCP fingerprinting to prevent MAC spoofing and to gather more reliable information about the device. DHCP requests do not include information about the vendor, device type, or model, but their structure is unique and different for most devices.\nPortnox Cloud uses specialist DHCP fingerprinting databases in partnership with other security providers. This lets Portnox Cloud submit the unique DHCP fingerprint and get information about most probable device make/model from those databases.\nDHCP fingerprints cannot be spoofed like MAC addresses, and therefore if a DHCP fingerprint is found in a database as an exact match, the information about the device make/model is reliable. However, there are rare cases when less common devices may not be recognized in DHCP fingerprint databases, or where DHCP fingerprints of two devices are identical.\nPortnox Cloud uses both the MAC address information and the DHCP fingerprinting information to specify the device make/model. It is thanks to using both of them at the same time, that this information can be as precise as possible.\nHowever, there are cases when none of the above information is available: there is no AgentP or LDAP onboarding to provide the information, and neither the MAC address nor the DHCP databases provide specific information about the device’s make, model, or type. In such situations, it is displayed in the device grid using its MAC address, and any other information is described as unknown.\nNote: The device type can change during the first connection of the device. This is because before the device fully connects to the network, the only piece of information available for fingerprinting is the MAC address. After the device connects to the NAS, Portnox Cloud can perform full fingerprinting."

  "text": "Quick start steps with Zero Trust Network Access\nIn this topic, you will learn the steps you need to take to configure the Portnox™ Zero Trust Network Access service.\nIf you already completed some of the steps, proceed to the next steps.\nNote: Portnox Cloud has functions to control network access, not just access to resources such as applications and services. If you only use Portnox Cloud for Zero Trust Network Access, in any of the configuration steps, you can skip the steps relating to network access and do only the steps related to resource access.\nCreate a Portnox Cloud tenant to access the service. \nIn this step, you create an account with Portnox Cloud and your own tenant. You only need to do this once.\nLog in to Portnox Cloud to start working with the service. \nIn this step, you access the tenant that you created earlier. You must complete this step every time you want to work with Portnox Cloud.\nConfigure your cloud-based authentication repository in Portnox Cloud. \nFor example:\nConfigure Microsoft Entra ID as your authentication repository.\nConfigure Google Workspace as your authentication repository.\nConfigure Okta Workforce Identity as your authentication repository.\nConfigure local Active Directory as your authentication repository.\nConfigure OpenLDAP as your authentication repository.\nAlternatively, manage your accounts internally within Portnox Cloud with Portnox accounts.\nConfigure access to SSO web applications: \nNote: You need to complete these steps only if you will be using Zero Trust Network Access to secure access to SSO web applications. If you will be using Zero Trust Network Access to secure access only to hosted resources, skip this step.\nConfigure an identity provider. \nThe identity provider is a web app, often configured in your authentication repository, that checks the identity of users of web applications. You should set up an identity provider that can work with the authentication repository you set up earlier in this process.\nConfigure applications to use ZTNA. \nFor each web application, the setup steps are different. We have a collection of guides for well-known web applications. However, if your application is not on the list, look at your application’s administrative guide. Search for topics like SAML integration.\nConfigure access to hosted resources: \nNote: You need to complete these steps only if you will be using Zero Trust Network Access to secure access to hosted resources. If you will be using Zero Trust Network Access to secure access only to SSO web applications, skip this step.\nCreate the Zero Trust Network Access gateway, run the Zero Trust Network Access Docker container, and add resources.\nIf you host your private resources on-premises and want to use a Linux machine as a gateway, configure a Linux-based Docker container.\nIf you host your private resources on-premises and want to use a Windows machine as a gateway, configure a Windows-based Docker container.\nOptional: Install AgentP on user devices or ask users to install AgentP on their devices. \nNote: Zero Trust Network Access needs a user certificate on the device to be able to authenticate with the resource. You can either get such a certificate by installing AgentP on the device, or by using an Intune/Jamf agent already on the device and configuring Intune/Jamf to work with the Portnox SCEP server.\nIf you want users to install AgentP, send them the following link: https://docs.portnox.com/byod/. These are end-user instructions for all popular desktop/mobile operating systems: Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. They teach the users how to install AgentP.\nIf you want to automatically distribute AgentP to user devices, here are some guides for popular endpoint management systems:\nMicrosoft Windows Group Policy\nMicrosoft Intune\nJamf\nKandji\nNote: If you choose this option, skip the next step.\nOptional: If you use Microsoft Intune or Jamf in your organization and you don’t want to use AgentP: \nIntegrate Portnox Cloud with Intune or Jamf. \nConfigure Intune or Jamf so that the devices request SCEP certificates from Portnox Cloud. \nNote: If you choose this option, skip the previous step.\nConfigure groups, policies, and more. \nOnce you have Zero Trust Network Access working, you can now adjust it specifically to your needs.\nManage groups of application users. \nGroups allow you to set different access policies for different users. For example, you can allow only your developers to access your development applications, and only your finance department to access your finance applications. If you choose to control this access at the application-level, you can create one group for all users.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one group called Default, which contains all your users that are not specifically assigned to any other groups.\nConfigure risk assessment policies and assign them to groups. \nRisk assessment policies help you check if a user’s device is secure enough to access applications. You can give different importance to various conditions, like not having antivirus software or using an old version of the operating system. If the total score exceeds a certain limit, you can consider the device as unsafe.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one risk assessment policy called System Default Policy, which is set up with recommended security measures for all operating systems, and which is assigned to the Default group.\nConfigure access control policies for applications and assign them to groups. \nAn access control policy for an application decides what to do if the risk assessment policy labels the device as unsafe. You can choose to let unsafe devices use your applications, or you can tell the user what they should do to make their device safe.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one access control policy called System Default Policy, which is set up to deny access to unsafe devices, and which is assigned to the Default group."

  "text": "Secure resources\nIn this topic, you will learn how Portnox ZTNA uses certificates – the same ones used for network access – to provide secure and controlled access to third-party applications and services (referred to as resources). This includes SSO-enabled web applications as well as on-premises resources like local web applications, allowing both local and remote users to safely connect to cloud resources and securely access on-premises and private cloud environments.\nSecurity risks in accessing cloud and on-premises resources\nIn this section, you will learn about the security shortcomings and challenges of common methods for accessing applications and resources: how SSO still relies on passwords and MFA with their inherent weaknesses, and how private resources are often accessed through VPNs that grant broad network access rather than limiting access to specific resources, while also being costly and complex to manage.\nOrganizations typically access their resources in two main ways: cloud-based web applications via traditional SSO platforms like Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta Workforce Identity, and on-premises or private cloud resources usually accessed through VPNs. Both approaches have significant security and usability limitations.\nIn the case of SSO-enabled web applications:\nThey are typically accessed using traditional SSO combined with MFA. These methods share the same vulnerabilities as passwords and MFA (see: Passwordless authentication).\nIf the SSO access is compromised, an attacker can gain access to all connected applications. Although major providers like Microsoft, Google, and Okta invest heavily in security, the fundamental weaknesses of passwords and MFA remain.\nSSO verifies the user’s identity but does not check the security or condition of the device being used. This means access could come from an insecure or compromised machine, such as one infected with a rootkit that can capture credentials and MFA tokens.\nIn the case of private resources hosted on-premises or in private clouds:\nThe most common method for accessing on-premises and private cloud resources is through VPNs, which tend to be expensive and complex to configure and maintain.\nVPNs create a network tunnel between the user’s device and the entire internal network, granting broad access to all applications and services without granular control. This means a potential attacker could explore and exploit multiple resources once inside.\nSimilar to SSO access, VPNs grant network access without verifying the security status of the user’s device, potentially allowing compromised devices with malware to gain unrestricted entry into the local network.\nEven if your network is secured with 802.1X and certificates, users often access resources from outside these protected environments, which significantly increases the risk of compromise through the weaknesses described above.\nSecure access to SSO-enabled web applications\nIn this section, you will learn how certificate-based authentication addresses the limitations of traditional SSO by adding an extra layer of security.\nRather than depending only on user login, passwords, and MFA at the identity provider, Portnox ZTNA uses certificate-based authentication to verify a certificate issued to the user on the specific device. This ensures that both the user and the device are trusted before access to web applications is granted.\nThis approach:\nPrevents attackers from accessing applications even if they have compromised user credentials and MFA. Although passwords and MFA are still used to log into the identity provider, they alone are insufficient to gain access to the application unless the attacker is using the device that holds a valid certificate for the user.\nEnhances security without adding complexity for the end user. Certificate verification happens automatically within the browser, requiring no additional action from the user.\nUses industry standards: SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC), which are supported by virtually all enterprise web applications that use SSO. Additionally, Entra ID’s Enterprise Application Management (EAM) is supported, allowing seamless access without requiring individual application configurations, as the process is managed directly by Entra ID’s identity provider.\nFollowing the initial setup, which typically involves copying and pasting addresses, identifiers, and certificates between the application’s configuration screen and Portnox Cloud, user access is then managed based on groups, policies, and risk assessment. For users, the only visible change during daily use is an additional screen at login confirming certificate verification.\nSecure access to private resources\nIn this section, you will learn how certificate-based authentication overcomes the limitations of VPNs by offering a significantly more secure way to access private applications on-premises or in private clouds.\nMany large organizations are actively seeking alternatives to traditional VPNs to securely provide remote access to private resources. Portnox ZTNA offers a breakthrough approach by combining certificate-based authentication with granular resource access and continuous risk assessment, delivering a level of security that meets the highest standards for private access.\nGranular access control: Unlike traditional VPNs, which typically grant users broad access to the entire network, ZTNA enforces strict, fine-grained policies that limit access to only the specific applications or resources the user is authorized for. This reduces the potential attack surface and prevents lateral movement within the network.\nCertificate-based authentication: ZTNA leverages strong, passwordless authentication using digital certificates installed on trusted devices. This verifies not only the user’s identity but also the security posture of the device itself, providing a much higher level of trust compared to username/password or even MFA alone.\nSimplified management: Centralized policy management in ZTNA solutions reduces administrative overhead. Unlike VPNs, which require complex configuration of gateways, tunnels, and network routing, ZTNA offers easier deployment and updates.\nImproved user experience: By automating certificate verification and eliminating the need for VPN clients, ZTNA provides seamless and transparent secure access. Users avoid complex login steps and network configurations, improving productivity and reducing support requests.\nFlexible Deployment: ZTNA supports secure access to both private cloud-based and on-premises resources without requiring extensive network redesign or complex VPN infrastructure, making it adaptable to diverse IT environments and hybrid cloud strategies.\nContinuous Risk Assessment (see: Risk assessment): Beyond initial authentication, ZTNA continuously monitors device health, security posture, and user behavior. Access can be automatically revoked or restricted if suspicious or risky activity is detected, helping to prevent compromised devices from gaining or maintaining access. VPNs lack this dynamic security layer. \nMeeting regulatory standards with certificate-based resource access\nIn this section, you will learn how certificate-based authentication with Portnox ZTNA helps organizations comply with key regulatory and security standards.\nRegulations such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO/IEC 27001 require strict control and monitoring of access not only to networks but also to critical resources and sensitive data. Portnox ZTNA uses certificate-based authentication combined with granular access policies to ensure that only trusted users and devices can reach specific resources, fulfilling these requirements. Comprehensive logging and continuous risk assessment provide the audit trails and ongoing security necessary for compliance and risk management.\nPCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Supports Requirement 8 (Identify and authenticate access to system components) by enforcing strong, certificate-based user and device authentication before resource access. Meets Requirement 10 (Track and monitor all access to network resources) through detailed logging of resource access and user activity.\nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Addresses the Security Rule’s Access Control Standard by restricting access to protected health information within resources to authorized users and secure devices only. Provides audit controls to monitor access and helps maintain data integrity by preventing unauthorized use.\nGDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): Helps meet Article 32 (Security of processing) by enforcing strict access controls on resources handling personal data. Audit logs created by ZTNA demonstrate accountability and support compliance with data protection principles.\nISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management): Aligns with Annex A.9 (Access Control) by requiring certificate-based authentication and policy enforcement for resource access. Supports Annex A.12.4 (Logging and Monitoring) with comprehensive records of user authentication and resource access events, enabling thorough audits.\nBy combining strong device and user authentication with granular, certificate-based access to resources, Portnox ZTNA simplifies compliance and improves security posture, all while reducing the complexity typical of traditional VPN and password-based solutions."

  "text": "Secure networks\nIn this topic, you will learn about the shortfalls of traditional networking and solutions that improve your network security to avoid being hacked.\nNetwork security risks in typical Ethernet and Wi-Fi setups\nIn this section, you will explore the common security risks associated with typical Ethernet and Wi-Fi setups. We’ll examine why these standard networks are often vulnerable to attacks and what makes them easy targets for malicious hackers.\nTypical Ethernet and pre-shared key Wi-Fi networks are easy to breach, allowing attackers to quickly escalate their access and reach critical systems. Once inside the network, attackers can use a variety of techniques to gain further access. Networks should be the first line of defense against hackers, but common network setups often fail to stop them.\nEthernet: Anyone who gains physical access to the premises, such as a contractor or technician, can plug into a network switch with an Ethernet cable and gain direct network access. Default network switch configurations do not prevent this.\nPre-shared key Wi-Fi: When an employee leaves, they still know the Wi-Fi password, and changing it for everyone each time someone leaves is often seen as too difficult or inconvenient. Additionally, current employees can easily share the password with others, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.\nThe only widely accepted industry standard that provides strong authentication and authorization for each Ethernet port and every Wi-Fi user is 802.1X. Other methods exist but are far less secure and effective compared to 802.1X.\n802.1X: The standard for secure network access\nIn this section, you will learn what 802.1X is and what it enables for network access control. The section explains its role in securing Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, its use with RADIUS for authentication, and how it forms the basis of WPA-Enterprise in wireless environments.\n802.1X (usually pronounced dot-one-ex) is a network access control standard developed by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), originally published in 2001 and most recently updated in IEEE Std 802.1X-2020. It defines a framework for authenticating users and devices using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), supporting a range of methods like passwords, certificates, and smart cards across both wired and wireless networks.\nEthernet: 802.1X allows network switches to require authentication before granting access to a device plugged into a port. Most managed switches support 802.1X and can be configured to block network access on a port until a valid user or device is authenticated using EAP through a RADIUS server. This prevents unauthorized devices from gaining access just by connecting a cable.\nWi-Fi: 802.1X is the foundation of WPA-Enterprise, which is supported by most business-grade access points and wireless controllers. Instead of using a shared Wi-Fi password, each user authenticates individually through EAP and a RADIUS server. This enables per-user access control and makes it much harder for unauthorized users to connect.\nIn both Ethernet and Wi-Fi setups, 802.1X relies on a RADIUS server to handle the authentication process, verifying the user’s or device’s credentials and informing the switch or access point whether to allow or deny network access. RADIUS is a protocol used to communicate authentication and authorization requests between network devices and an authentication server. In an 802.1X setup, the network device sends user credentials to a RADIUS server using this protocol, and the server verifies the information before granting or denying access.\nCloud-based 802.1X: The future of network access control\nIn this section, we explain why cloud-based 802.1X solutions offer a more cost-effective and flexible alternative to traditional on-premises hardware setups.\nCloud-based 802.1X removes the dependency on expensive, specialized hardware and lowers the complexity of managing network access control. It offers greater flexibility, easier scalability, and faster deployment compared to traditional on-premises solutions tied to physical equipment.\nTraditional 802.1X solutions require buying and maintaining physical hardware, which adds upfront and ongoing costs. Cloud-based solutions handle authentication remotely, removing the need for on-site devices.\nOn-premises setups often need local access for configuration and troubleshooting. Cloud management allows IT teams to control authentication from anywhere through a simple web interface.\nAdding users or locations to traditional systems means buying more hardware and complex setup. Cloud-based 802.1X scales easily by adjusting resources without physical installation.\nUpdating on-premises equipment requires manual work and scheduled downtime. Cloud services deliver updates automatically, ensuring continuous security improvements.\nIntegrating traditional solutions with modern identity and security systems often requires additional tools and complex setups. Cloud-based 802.1X connects directly to cloud identity platforms as well as works together with UEM, and SIEM solutions, making integration simpler and more efficient.\nHardware failures and maintenance cause network downtime in on-premises systems. Cloud providers use redundant infrastructure to reduce disruptions and improve availability.\nIn a cloud-based 802.1X setup, network devices like switches and access points communicate authentication requests from users or devices to a cloud-hosted RADIUS server. When a device tries to connect, the network equipment forwards its credentials securely to the cloud service, which verifies the information against centralized authentication repositories. Once the user or device is authenticated, the cloud server signals the network device to grant or deny access. This approach removes the need for on-premises authentication hardware and allows for centralized, remote management of network access policies.\nA common concern with cloud-based network access control is what happens during an Internet outage, specifically whether users will lose network access if Portnox Cloud becomes temporarily unreachable. In such cases, active sessions are not interrupted and connected users remain online. However, new authentication requests cannot be processed by the cloud during the outage. To address this, Portnox Cloud supports a local cache component that runs on-premises as a virtual machine or Docker container. This local fallback allows previously authenticated users to reauthenticate and maintain access based on cached credentials and policies. New users or devices that have not connected before will be denied access until connectivity to the cloud is restored.\nSecure access for devices that can’t use 802.1X\nIn this section, you will learn how devices that do not support 802.1X can still be securely connected to the network using MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB), and how Portnox helps manage and control access for these devices.\nWhile nearly all modern computers, mobile devices, and operating systems support 802.1X for secure network authentication, many office devices do not. These include printers, IP phones, badge readers, video conferencing systems, and even some IoT devices. Despite their lack of 802.1X support, these devices still need to connect to the network securely. Simply leaving Ethernet ports open for such devices poses a serious security risk – anyone could unplug the device and connect an unauthorized laptop. Likewise, creating a shared Wi-Fi SSID with a common password introduces more risks and undermines the purpose of secure network access.\nThis is where MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) comes in. MAB is a fallback authentication method used when a device does not support 802.1X. Instead of using user or certificate-based authentication, MAB identifies a device based on its MAC (Media Access Control) address – a unique hardware identifier assigned to the device’s network interface.\nWhat happens when a non-802.1X device connects to the network?\nThe device connects to a switch port or wireless access point, but does not initiate 802.1X authentication.\nThe switch or access point detects the lack of 802.1X response and triggers MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB).\nThe network device sends the MAC address of the connected device to Portnox Cloud, requesting authentication.\nPortnox checks the MAC address against its known devices list and applies the appropriate access control policy.\nIf the MAC address is recognized and allowed, the device is granted access with the defined permissions (e.g., VLAN assignment or limited access). If the MAC is unknown or blacklisted, access is denied or restricted to a remediation network.\nWhile MAB enables access for non-802.1X devices, it is inherently less secure because MAC addresses can be easily spoofed. Many devices – including most laptop network adapters – allow users to manually set the MAC address, and modern smartphones like iPhones often use randomized MAC addresses to enhance privacy. This poses a challenge for relying on MAC addresses for authentication. For example, an attacker could identify the MAC address of a legitimate device, disconnect it, and then connect their own laptop using the same MAC address.\nTo prevent this type of spoofing, Portnox Cloud uses an advanced IoT fingerprinting mechanism. This works by analyzing the DHCP traffic a device generates upon connection – traffic patterns that are highly specific to each device type and operating system. If another device later connects using the same MAC address but presents a different DHCP fingerprint, Portnox Cloud immediately identifies the mismatch, issues a warning, and blocks the connection, helping to maintain the integrity of network access.\nCentralized management for 802.1X authentication\nIn this section, you will learn how cloud-based 802.1X can integrate with your current user databases and authentication systems.\nCloud-based 802.1X works with your existing user databases and authentication systems, so there is no need to create or manage separate credentials. This simplifies administration and enhances security by keeping user management centralized in one place.\nReusing existing user repositories like Active Directory, Google Workspace, Okta Workforce Identity, or Entra ID reduces the need to create and maintain multiple accounts, lowering the chance of errors and inconsistencies.\nCentralized authentication simplifies management by applying consistent access policies across all systems, reducing administrative overhead and improving compliance.\nCloud-based 802.1X supports standard protocols to integrate smoothly with common directory services such as LDAP and modern identity providers, enabling flexible deployment.\nManaging users from a single authentication source improves security by reducing potential attack points.\nUsing familiar authentication platforms speeds up user onboarding and offboarding, ensuring access rights are updated quickly and accurately without extra manual steps.\nWhile these integrations provide significant benefits, Portnox Cloud also offers its own internal authentication repository, which can be used alongside existing systems, for example, to manage contractors, or independently without relying on any external directory.\nProviding secure access for guests and temporary users\nIn this section, you will learn how to securely provide limited network access to guests, contractors, and other temporary users who are not included in your organization’s authentication repository, using captive portals and other access controls.\nSome users – such as contractors, auditors, temporary workers, visitors, or vendors – are not added to the organization’s main authentication repository but still require Internet or limited network access while on-site. These users need a simplified access method without full onboarding.\nPortnox Cloud offers guest access primarily through captive portals, which are functions provided by network access devices (NAS) such as wireless access points, routers, or wireless controllers. Captive portals are used exclusively for Wi-Fi access and do not apply to wired Ethernet connections. The captive portal serves as the authentication gateway for guests, supporting various authentication methods including sponsored guest approval by internal users, SMS confirmation codes sent to the guest’s mobile device, or simple acceptance of terms via a disclaimer.\nTo enable captive portal functionality, compatible network equipment is required, as Portnox Cloud relies on these devices to enforce captive portal authentication and control network access. Compared to basic captive portals configured solely on network devices, integrating captive portals with Portnox Cloud provides extra benefits:\nProvides a single, unified portal management interface for guest policies and user accounts, even though captive portals still run on individual network devices\nEnables advanced guest authentication options like sponsored guest approvals and SMS confirmation codes, which standalone portals may not support\nCentralizes guest access logging and reporting for compliance, consolidating data from multiple devices into one system\nSimplifies onboarding and lifecycle management of guest users without configuring each device separately beyond enabling the captive portal function\nSupports seamless integration with Portnox Cloud’s broader access management ecosystem through a single portal\nContractor accounts offer a solution for users who need broader access than typical guests. These accounts are created directly in Portnox Cloud without adding users to the main authentication repository and use external email addresses. Unlike captive portal guests, contractor accounts support both Wi-Fi and Ethernet access. Since they function like regular user accounts, administrators can assign them to groups, allowing controlled and flexible access to internal resources.\nSecuring administrative access to network devices\nThis section explains how TACACS+ can be used with Portnox Cloud to control administrative access to network infrastructure devices such as switches, firewalls, and routers.\nTACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus) is a protocol commonly used to manage and authenticate administrative access to network devices. It separates authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA), making it a preferred choice for network device management where fine-grained control is needed over who can run which commands.\nPortnox Cloud includes support for TACACS+ via an on-prem component running in a virtual machine or a Docker container. It provides centralized management of admin logins for compatible NAS devices such as enterprise switches, firewalls, and wireless controllers. This allows administrators to define who can access specific devices, what commands they can execute, and to maintain full audit logs of access activity – all managed through the same Portnox Cloud interface used for user and device access control.\nBenefits of TACACS+ with Portnox Cloud:\nLocal TACACS+ proxy with cloud policy control – While a lightweight on-premises component is required, all policy logic and user validation happens in the cloud, reducing local configuration complexity.\nCentralized management of admin access policies – All TACACS+ access rules are defined and managed in the Portnox Cloud UI, ensuring consistent enforcement across all supported network devices.\nUnified identity source – Reuse the same identity providers (e.g., AD, LDAP) configured in Portnox Cloud for user authentication, without managing a separate local database.\nRole-based command control – Define what administrative commands or privilege levels are available per user or group across different network device types.\nConsolidated auditing – Admin login attempts and executed commands are logged centrally, enabling comprehensive audit trails for compliance and security reviews.\nUsing Portnox Cloud for TACACS+ removes the need to run and maintain an on-prem TACACS+ server while still allowing advanced AAA policy control for infrastructure devices. This setup is useful in medium to large environments where managing admin access on a per-device basis becomes operationally complex and less secure.\nMeeting regulatory standards with cloud-based 802.1X\nIn this section, you will learn how cloud-based 802.1X helps organizations meet key regulatory and security standards.\nStandards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO/IEC 27001 require organizations to control and monitor access to their networks. Cloud-based 802.1X enforces user and device authentication before network access, fulfilling access control requirements. Its centralized logging and reporting provide the audit trails needed to prove compliance. Continuous monitoring supports risk management and timely incident response, which are key parts of these standards.\nPCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Helps meet Requirement 8 (Identify and authenticate access to system components) by enforcing strong user and device authentication before network access. Also supports Requirement 10 (Track and monitor all access to network resources) through centralized logging of authentication events.\nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Addresses the Security Rule’s Access Control Standard by restricting network access to authorized users and devices. Provides audit controls for access monitoring and helps with the Integrity Standard by preventing unauthorized access to protected health information.\nGDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): Supports Article 32 (Security of processing) by implementing appropriate access controls to protect personal data. Provides audit logs that help demonstrate accountability and compliance with data protection principles.\nISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management): Aligns with Annex A.9 (Access Control) by enforcing user authentication and authorization on network devices. Supports Annex A.12.4 (Logging and Monitoring) with detailed records of access attempts and changes, enabling audit readiness.\nCloud-based 802.1X provides easier management and clearer audit information, helping organizations meet such regulatory requirements without the complexity of traditional hardware-based solutions."

  "text": "About Portnox Cloud\nIn this topic, you will learn about the basic concepts behind Portnox™ Cloud and its architecture.\nWhat is Portnox Cloud?\nPortnox Cloud is a zero-trust, cloud-based network access control solution that offers continuous monitoring and management of devices connecting to your networks. It provides visibility, risk management, and authentication for endpoints in any location, including IoT, bring-your-own-device (BYOD), and managed devices across various types of networks. The cloud delivery ensures that the solution is always up to date with the latest features and capabilities. Access to the network can be granted based on user/device identity and/or risk profile.\nPortnox Cloud is easy to set up and can be configured in even only a few minutes for the first devices.\nHow does Portnox Cloud work?\nIn a standard network, devices usually connect to the company network using one of the following methods:\nFor a wired device, you simply connect the Ethernet cable to the switch.\nFor a wireless device, you select the network (SSID) and enter a password common for all devices.\nThis is not a secure approach. It may let an intruder access your network easily, using any Ethernet cable or by obtaining a password that many other people use. Instead, you can use Portnox Cloud for a zero-trust approach:\nWhen you connect the Ethernet cable to the secured network switch, your device has no access to the network at all. When you try to connect your device to the secured Wi-Fi using a common password, it refuses the connection.\nTo connect to the network, you must authenticate. To do that, you either enter your corporate email and a password, connect to your company identity service (for example, Entra ID or Google Workspace), or use a secure user/device certificate generated for your device.\nThe network switch or Wi-Fi access point contacts the Cloud RADIUS server automatically, checks the user credentials based on your company directory, and receives a reply that says if it should allow your device to access the network or not. Additionally, the Cloud RADIUS server indicates the network to connect to, for example, a department network, an Internet-access-only network, or a quarantine network.\nNote that devices such as IoT, which are unmanned, can simply be recognized by their MAC addresses instead. Portnox Cloud also works with VPN networks. You can also create guest accounts and control guest user access.\nHow does Portnox Cloud monitor risk?\nWith the addition of Portnox AgentP, Portnox Cloud can do even more: monitor the risk of your device and manage network access on the basis of that risk. It can even remediate certain risk conditions.\nYou can create risk profiles for different devices. For example, you can decide that a mobile phone that has an outdated operating system and applications from unknown sources is too risky to connect to your network. Or you can decide that a laptop with no disk encryption needs to be connected to a limited network with Internet access only and no access to company resources.\nYou can configure Portnox AgentP, for example, to discover that your device has an outdated antivirus or operating system, and automatically start an update. You can also configure it to automatically uninstall a suspicious application. This way, AgentP can remediate the device to lower its risk profile, and then let it access the network without your intervention.\nPortnox Cloud architecture"

  "text": "Risk assessment\nIn this topic, you will learn how continuous risk assessment evaluates the security posture of devices and users, ensuring that access is granted only to trusted, uncompromised endpoints.\nThe risks behind network and application access\nIn this section, you will learn about the potential risks when a device attempts to connect to a network or applications, and the possible security consequences if these risks are exploited.\nDevices get compromised more easily than you might think. Sometimes, a simple misclick can install malware on a computer or mobile device. It could also be as easy as plugging in an infected USB stick or connecting to a rogue network cable. Once compromised, attackers can leverage everything the device has access to, including its security certificate that grants network or application entry.\nThis is why organizations need to assess multiple security conditions dynamically based on their risk tolerance. Some examples include:\nEnsuring the device has up-to-date system patches and antivirus software, firewalls, encryption, or verifying it only runs approved software and necessary security services.\nConfirming the device is enrolled in a UEM/MDM solution and actively managed, enabling continuous oversight of its security posture.\nDetecting whether the device blocks installations from untrusted sources or, for mobiles, isn’t jailbroken/rooted with elevated privileges that weaken security.\nConsidering the device’s geographic location, such as blocking access if detected in high-risk or hostile countries, which can also indicate theft.\nGranting access to a device, even when the user is authorized and a certificate is present, without evaluating these security conditions severely weakens the organization’s overall security. It only takes one vulnerable entry point for a major breach to occur, a lesson many organizations have already learned the hard way.\nContinuous risk assessment with Portnox AgentP\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox’s optional software, AgentP, helps assess and mitigate security risks, as well as what options are available if you prefer not to use AgentP.\nThe most reliable way to gather accurate security risk information from a device is by installing a secure agent on it. Portnox provides its own trusted agent, AgentP, which delivers all the essential functions an endpoint needs to fully utilize Portnox Cloud and ZTNA:\nContinuously assesses the security posture of the device in real time\nEnforces security policies and configurations on the endpoint\nRequests, installs, and manages digital certificates for authentication\nCommunicates securely with Portnox Cloud for risk evaluation and access decisions\nProvides detailed endpoint telemetry for centralized visibility and reporting\nIf you prefer not to install an additional agent on your devices, you can leverage Portnox’s integration with Microsoft Intune or Jamf to continuously monitor the security posture of your devices. These UEM/MDM systems perform ongoing security assessments and collect detailed device information.\nUsing the risk data provided by Intune or Jamf, Portnox Cloud and ZTNA can make access decisions based on whether a device is flagged as risky or secure. Although this method doesn’t offer the same depth of detail as the Portnox AgentP, it still allows effective risk-based control without adding extra software to your endpoints.\nIntegration with Intune and Jamf also enables you to request and install certificates on your devices through these UEM/MDM systems. However, you can also use many other UEM/MDM systems for that purpose, provided they support the SCEP protocol for certificate requests. Note that Portnox as of now does not provide risk assessment using other UEM/MDM software.\nEnforcement actions based on risk\nIn this section, you will learn what types of access enforcement actions can be taken based on the results of risk assessment and what happens after risk is remediated.\nPortnox Cloud and ZTNA offer different enforcement actions based on risk results. These actions control access at both the network level (like 802.1X) and application level (through ZTNA). Options include blocking network access completely, limiting access to certain VLANs or network parts (for example, a quarantine VLAN), restricting access to some applications, or allowing access but sending alerts.\nThe enforcement actions can be adjusted depending on the policy settings for the user’s group, the application, and the organization’s security rules and risk level. Some organizations block users or devices with any risk, others limit access to only safe networks or apps. Some just send warnings to admins but allow full access. This lets organizations be flexible depending on the situation. For example:\nFull access denied – for networks, the device cannot access the network at all. For apps or resources, access is fully blocked.\nLimited access – for networks, the device can only access certain VLANs or parts of the network like the Internet or low-risk networks. For apps or resources, access is only to those that are low-risk.\nAccess granted with warnings – the device and user can access networks and apps, but admins get alerts about the device’s risk level.\nIf a user is denied or has limited access, once the risks are fixed and the user or device tries again, Cloud will check the policies again and restore access. Cloud can also take automatic remediation actions to fix some risks on the device using AgentP, like turning antivirus back on.\nRisk management for unmanaged devices\nThis section explains how Portnox Cloud assesses and manages the security risks posed by unmanaged devices, such as contractor or BYOD devices that are not enrolled in a UEM/MDM system.\nIn many organizations, employees are allowed to use their own devices (BYOD), and there are often external workers such as contractors, auditors, consultants, or temporary staff who bring equipment managed by other companies and need to connect to local networks. These unmanaged devices can pose unique security challenges.\nPortnox Cloud provides a baseline solution by allowing such devices to connect via a guest network and captive portal, as well as through contractor accounts (see: Secure networks). Since devices connecting this way are not covered by risk assessment, administrators typically grant them minimal privileges needed to maintain network security. Risk assessment is not possible unless the device is enrolled with the company’s Intune/Jamf or has AgentP installed and enrolled.\nFor corporate users with BYOD devices, the user can quickly install AgentP and enroll using their regular corporate account. AgentP then monitors risk on the BYOD device just like on corporate-managed devices, allowing access only to resources deemed secure according to the group’s policies and risk level. This enables organizations to securely support BYOD usage, giving users the flexibility to use their own devices such as private mobile phones."

  "text": "Passwordless authentication\nIn this topic, you will learn what passwordless authentication is, why it offers stronger security and better user experience than traditional passwords, and how it is not a new idea but remains underused. You will also see how passwordless methods integrate with secure networking to reduce risks and improve access control.\nThe security gaps in passwords and multi-factor authentication\nIn this section, you will learn why passwords, while theoretically secure, are highly vulnerable in real-world use, and how even traditional multi-factor authentication can be bypassed through phishing, device compromise, or social engineering.\nPasswords were a solid idea when users had just one to remember and attackers lacked the computing power to crack them. But over time, systems multiplied and so did the number of passwords users had to manage. To stay secure, passwords became longer and more complex—harder to remember and easier to mishandle. As a result, people reuse them across services, choose weak ones that are easy to guess, or rely on predictable patterns based on personal information. This makes passwords a major vulnerability rather than a line of defense.\nNo visibility into reuse: There is no reliable way for an organization to verify whether a user has reused the same password on other personal or work-related systems, increasing the risk of compromise through credential stuffing or data breaches elsewhere.\nComplexity requirements backfire: Enforcing complex password rules (e.g. symbols, numbers, uppercase letters) may improve theoretical security, but in practice users often write them down, save them in unsecured files, or store them in browsers without proper protection.\nFrequent password changes lead to poor practices: When forced to change passwords regularly, users tend to modify the existing one slightly (e.g. adding a number or changing one letter), which results in weak variations that are easy to guess or crack.\nPassword managers are not a universal solution: While password managers help generate and store strong credentials, they are often too complicated or inconvenient for daily use by average users. Some cloud-based password managers have also suffered major security breaches, undermining trust.\nPhishing remains highly effective: Even strong, unique passwords can be stolen if users are tricked into entering them into fake login pages or malicious websites. Attackers often rely on social engineering rather than technical flaws to gain access.\nPasswords can be extracted from compromised devices: If a user’s device is infected with malware or already compromised, stored or entered passwords can often be retrieved by attackers regardless of their complexity.\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) was introduced as a solution to the problems with passwords. Initially, this meant sending one-time codes via SMS, but those were soon found to be vulnerable to SIM swapping and interception. Authenticator apps followed, offering stronger security, but even those can be bypassed in various ways. While MFA adds a layer of protection, it is not foolproof.\nSIM swapping and SMS interception: Attackers can trick or bribe mobile carriers into transferring a victim’s phone number to a new SIM card, allowing them to receive MFA codes sent via SMS.\nPhishing for MFA codes: Fake login pages can prompt users for both passwords and MFA codes, forwarding the credentials in real time to attackers.\nMan-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: Tools like reverse proxies can intercept login sessions and tokens, bypassing both passwords and MFA.\nMalware on the user’s device: If a device is already compromised, attackers can access MFA tokens, session cookies, or intercept authentication flows directly.\nPush fatigue (MFA fatigue attacks): In push-based MFA, attackers repeatedly send login approval requests to the user’s phone, hoping the user approves one out of annoyance or confusion.\nSolving password problems with passwordless authentication\nIn this section, you will learn what passwordless authentication is, the most common methods used today, and how these approaches work together to remove the risks and limitations of passwords entirely.\nPasswords can be guessed, stolen, or misused, but passwordless authentication removes them entirely from the login process, eliminating many of the most common attack paths. By relying on factors that are harder to steal or replicate, passwordless methods provide both stronger security and a better user experience.\nDevice-based certificates: A digital certificate installed on a trusted device is used to authenticate the user automatically, without the need to enter any secret. Certificates are hard to steal and can be revoked if the device is lost.\nBiometric authentication: Fingerprint scans, face recognition, or other biometrics ensure the person logging in is the authorized user. Biometrics are stored securely on the device and never transmitted.\nPhysical security keys: Physical keys act as a secure hardware-based method of proving identity. Even if the key is stolen, it often requires a user gesture (like a touch) to confirm use.\nPlatform-based authentication: These built-in systems link device identity, biometrics, and cryptographic keys to allow fast and secure authentication tied to the local device.\nWhen combined, for example, using device certificates with biometric verification, these methods create a strong, layered approach that significantly reduces the risk of compromise. Over the past decade, breaches involving compromised passwords have been widespread. In contrast, incidents involving breaches through passwordless authentication methods are exceedingly rare.\nHow digital certificates work in passwordless authentication\nIn this section, you will learn what digital certificates are, why they provide stronger security than passwords, how they are issued and managed, and how they enable secure, passwordless authentication for devices and users.\nDigital certificates for authenticating users and devices aren’t a recent innovation. They have been integral to secure communications since the 1990s, notably in SSH (Secure Shell) protocols, which began supporting them as an extension to address key distribution challenges.\nMajor operating systems like Windows and macOS have incorporated certificate-based authentication for years. Windows introduced support for X.509 certificates with its Certificate Services in Windows 2000, while macOS has utilized certificates within its Keychain Access system since at least macOS 10.4 Tiger, released in 2005.\nAlthough digital certificates have been around for a long time, many security solutions continue to rely on less secure authentication methods. Portnox Cloud fully supports certificate-based authentication and recommends it as a more secure alternative to traditional credential-based approaches.\nA certificate is issued and installed directly on a device, and the operating system prevents it from being copied or moved to another device. This ensures that only the specific device, or the authorized user on that device, holds that unique certificate, helping to tightly control access.\nIf a device with an installed certificate is lost, stolen, or compromised, the certificate can be revoked by the organization. Revoking the certificate means it will no longer be accepted for authentication, and a new certificate must be issued before the device can regain access once it is recovered.\nCertificates use strong cryptographic algorithms that make them practically impossible to forge or hack. This high level of security prevents attackers from creating fake certificates or impersonating authorized devices.\nOrganizations can issue certificates internally and distribute them to devices using various methods such as UEM/MDM tools, dedicated agents, or secure web portals. This flexible approach allows certificates to be used on many device types, including laptops, mobile devices, and certain IoT equipment, not just traditional computers and smartphones.\nWhile certificates verify that the device itself is trusted and a specific user account is logged in, they do not confirm the identity of the person using it. Because of this, certificates should be combined with local device authentication methods – preferably secure, passwordless options like biometrics – to confirm that the authorized user is the one accessing the device.\nSecuring networks with certificates, 802.1X, and RADIUS\nIn this section, you will learn how 802.1X and RADIUS work seamlessly with digital certificates to provide strong network security, and how all major operating systems across various devices support these standards, enabling nearly all computers and mobile devices to connect to networks using passwordless authentication.\nThe 802.1X protocol (see: Secure networks) was specifically designed to support passwordless authentication using digital certificates, enabling secure verification of both users and devices. Through the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and its communication with RADIUS servers, the network can authenticate devices based on their unique certificates, ensuring trusted access without relying on passwords.\nCertificates must first be installed on devices before they can be used for network authentication:\nThe organization uses Portnox Cloud to issue a certificate to the device or its user. Alternatively, certificates can be issued using the organization’s own certificate authority.\nCertificates are delivered and installed using UEM/MDM tools, the optional Portnox agent software (AgentP), or through the self-onboarding portal (recommended for IoT devices such as printers).\nThe certificate is securely stored on the device and is bound to that specific device or user. It can now be used for various authentication purposes.\nOnce installed, the certificate is used to authenticate the device on the network:\nThe user device (often referred to as the supplicant) requests network access using 802.1X by communicating with the NAS device, such as a switch or access point, which enforces 802.1X on a specific port (Ethernet) or SSID (Wi-Fi). The device then presents its certificate via EAP to the NAS device.\nThe NAS device contacts the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server and forwards the certificate for authentication. Portnox Cloud verifies the certificate’s validity, confirms the user’s or device’s identity against the authentication repository, checks for revocation, and then responds to the NAS device with a recommendation to either allow or deny access.\nThe NAS device enforces the decision based on the response from the RADIUS server.\nPasswordless access to cloud and on-prem applications and resources\nIn this section, you will learn how digital certificates can be used not only for network authentication, but also to control access to internal and cloud-based applications and resources.\nWhile securing access to the network is essential, the real goal is to protect the applications and resources that are part of that network, whether they’re hosted in the cloud or on-premises. Most cloud-based applications rely on identity providers like Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta Workforce Identity, while internal applications often require remote access through complex VPN setups that provide limited security control and visibility.\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) services like those from Microsoft, Google, or Okta allow users to access cloud-based applications without re-entering passwords, which improves user experience and reduces reliance on weak credentials. However, SSO alone doesn’t evaluate the device being used — meaning an untrusted, outdated, or compromised device can still access sensitive data.\nPortnox ZTNA extends this model by requiring the same certificate used for secure network access to also be presented by the browser during application access. This adds a strong device-based verification step before granting access, ensuring the device is recognized and trusted.\nTraditional VPNs are often the only way for users to reach internal applications or private cloud applications, but they come with downsides: they’re expensive, difficult to configure and maintain, and they provide broad access to the internal network once connected. This all-or-nothing approach means users who need access to just one internal service may end up with visibility into the entire network.\nPortnox ZTNA avoids this by authenticating access to specific applications using the same certificate used for Wi-Fi, wired networks, and SSO-based applications — allowing precise, certificate-based access to internal resources without exposing the rest of the network.\nOne certificate, issued and managed by Portnox or the organization, serves as a secure passport granting access not only to the network but also as an additional layer of security for SSO applications. It enables controlled access to on-premises and private cloud applications without exposing the entire internal network. Beyond simple authentication, this infrastructure also performs risk assessment, ensuring that devices are not just trusted but also free from compromise that could undermine security."

  "text": "Manage your administrator account\nIn this topic, you will learn how to manage your Portnox™ Cloud administrator account.\nNote: The term account in Portnox Cloud is used for the collection of configurations for a device connecting to the network. The term administrator account refers to the collection of configurations enabling you to administer Cloud. However, in the Cloud interface, it can also be abbreviated as account.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Portnox Cloud left-hand menu, click on the option. \nYour administrator account information is displayed on the right-hand side.\nNote: The available options on the right-hand side depend on whether your administrator account is managed by Cloud or if you are using an administrator account integrated with an external repository (Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta). If you are using an external repository, most of the details cannot be changed as they are stored there. \nTo change your administrator account password, click on the Change password link in the ACCOUNT SETTINGS section.

  "text": "Interoperability\nIn this topic, you will learn how secure networking and secure resources rely on strong integration with your existing software and systems, and what options Portnox provides to achieve this interoperability.\nSecure networking and secure resource access work only when systems are connected. If every network, application, or system required its own login, users would quickly fall back on weak practices – reusing, simplifying, or storing passwords insecurely. Linking systems so one secure authentication works everywhere removes these weak points, reduces friction, and enforces strong, consistent security.\nAdministrators face the same challenge. Managing each security platform in isolation makes it harder to spot issues and slower to respond. Direct integrations allow security data to flow into central tools such as SIEM, giving the security team a complete, real-time view without constant manual cross-checking. It also avoids duplication – for example, if the organization already uses Intune for risk assessment, that same intelligence can be applied to control network and application access.\nPortnox solves these problems. When a user signs in to their device with the organization’s central authentication, which could be through a third-party cloud service like Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta, the device is issued a unique certificate tied only to that user and that specific device – it cannot be moved or reused elsewhere. Once issued, it serves as the foundation for all other access: internal resources and third-party web apps all trust the same certificate. The network validates against the same certificate, so the user can connect to the company Wi-Fi or Ethernet and access applications without extra logins. Behind the scenes, integrated systems verify identity, check authorization, and assess device risk – while for the user, it simply feels like “it just works.”\nAuthentication repositories\nIn this chapter, you will learn how Portnox Cloud connects to authentication repositories (also called identity stores, user directories, or credential databases) to use their data for authentication and authorization, and how its internal repository can be used when no central system exists.\nIf administrators had to recreate every company user and assign new passwords just to provide access to the network and applications, the solution would be impractical. That’s why it’s essential for any network and application security solution to rely on users that the company already manages elsewhere.\nAll but the smallest companies use some kind of user repository, which is primarily used for logging in to computers as well as any SSO-enabled cloud applications the company currently uses (as an identity provider). For Windows environments, this is most commonly Entra ID, which integrates seamlessly with the operating system. However, this is not always the case. Some companies may use separate systems – for example, computer login might use one directory, while a Google Workspace suite handles email and cloud apps, requiring a second login.\nPortnox avoids adding yet another set of credentials. By integrating with your existing repository, Portnox Cloud allows users to authenticate to the network without needing a second or third password. Once integrated with a repository in Cloud, administrators can import all users or select groups, and assign them to relevant Cloud groups. This allows network access and application access to be managed independently from the repository’s internal group structure.\nPortnox Cloud supports all major industry-standard authentication repositories, including:\nEntra ID: Widely used in Windows-centric environments, providing seamless integration for devices and applications within Microsoft ecosystems.\nGoogle Workspace (GWS): Ideal for organizations that prefer Google services over Microsoft, enabling single sign-on and centralized user management across cloud-based applications.\nOkta Workforce Identity: Although less widespread, Okta has a strong niche in organizations that prioritize cloud-first identity management with flexible integration capabilities.\nActive Directory (AD): Supports traditional on-premises repositories, giving organizations that prefer not to rely entirely on cloud solutions the ability to manage users and groups locally.\nLDAP: For any other on-premises directories, Portnox supports LDAP connections.\nBoth AD and generic LDAP are supported via a custom agent that allows seamless integration with on-premises directories. Note that since AD and LDAP are not identity providers, they cannot be used for cloud application access control.\nCentralized event management\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox Cloud sends alerts and activity logs to SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems.\nPortnox Cloud integrates with major SIEM systems using universal standards, ensuring compatibility with both cloud-based and on-premises solutions:\nOffers direct HTTPS connections to well-known cloud providers, with Portnox continuously expanding integrations to additional third-party products.\nSupports the syslog standard, allowing alerts and logs to be sent to syslog collectors over UDP, TCP, or TLS. These collectors can then forward the data to SIEM systems. Syslog is supported by most cloud SIEM products.\nDelivers messages in JSON or CEF (Common Event Format), two widely recognized standards supported by most SIEM platforms.\nFor on-premises systems, provides a Docker container or uses the existing AD/LDAP agent to integrate with the cloud. The agent periodically retrieves data from the cloud and supplies it to the on-premises SIEM, allowing for integration with any on-premises SIEM solutions.\nPortnox has been tested with various SIEM systems, including Microsoft Sentinel, Rapid7 InsightIDR, Sumo Logic, Splunk, Datadog, Papertrail, Loggly, NXLog, and Kiwi Syslog Server. As long as a SIEM system supports industry standards, Portnox can integrate effectively.\nAdministrators can configure which alerts and events to forward to the SIEM, allowing them to filter out messages such as synchronization-completed alerts, ensuring that only required data is transmitted.\nEndpoint management\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox works with UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) and MDM (Mobile Device Management) systems to deliver device certificates using the SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) standard.\nThere are three ways to have Portnox Cloud issue certificates and deliver them to devices for passwordless authentication. One method requires distributing Portnox AgentP to devices, which some organizations may avoid due to concerns about adding extra agents. Another method requires the user to manually request a certificate through a web interface, which is not ideal for automatic enrollment. The third method leverages integration with existing UEM/MDM systems to automate certificate delivery without adding extra agents or requiring manual requests.\nUEM/MDM system already have an agent – either built into the operating system (for example, Intune works with Windows natively) or a background agent installed on the device. These agents handle standard management tasks, such as delivering configurations and installing or removing software, and can also manage certificates. Portnox indirectly uses these agents to enable automatic certificate issuance and delivery to devices.\nThe flow of certificate issuance via UEM/MDM works as follows:\nIf a device requires a certificate for a user or the device itself, the UEM/MDM system agent sends a configuration to the device.\nThe device then formally sends a SCEP request to Portnox Cloud using its operating system’s SCEP client, directed by the UEM/MDM agent. The UEM/MDM agent acts as an initiator by instructing the device’s operating system where to send the request and what information to include, such as an ID from the UEM/MDM system, which helps Cloud identify the user and device through its integration with the UEM/MDM system.\nPortnox Cloud receives the request, issues the certificate, and delivers it back to the device via SCEP.\nPortnox has been tested with many UEM/MDM systems and platforms, including the following:\nIntune\nGoogle\nJamf\nKandji\nAddigy\nWorkspace One\nSOTI\nMaaS360\nAs long as the operating system fully supports the SCEP standard, and the UEM/MDM solution has SCEP support for all operating systems, Portnox will work with them.\nWeb application access\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox ZTNA supports web applications using industry-standard single sign-on (SSO) methods.\nSingle sign-on (SSO) is a standard method for accessing web applications, and most organizations benefit from it. For example, users with company Entra ID credentials can access third-party cloud apps used by the organization without separate logins. Security can be further enhanced with certificate-based authentication, ensuring that only specific devices – or those that additionally meet risk assessment policies – can access these applications, without inconveniencing users.\nThe access flow with Portnox ZTNA works as follows:\nThe user accesses a web application that supports a custom SAML login. Typically, such applications provide a separate login button for custom SAML or recognize the domain secured by ZTNA from the supplied email address. After clicking the button or providing the email, the application redirects the user to ZTNA for preliminary checks.\nZTNA verifies the presence of a certificate stored in the operating system and accessible to the browser. If configured, it additionally retrieves device risk assessment information from the relevant agent to ensure compliance with security policies.\nIf the certificate and risk checks pass, control is forwarded to the organization’s identity provider – Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta. The user may then need to authenticate using the organization’s standard credentials, unless already authenticated in the browser.\nOnce authentication with the organization’s identity provider succeeds, access is granted to the application.\nThe ZTNA flow only introduces one additional step, which is minimally visible to the user. In the worst case, the user may need to click or confirm a certificate from a browser-displayed list, but in many cases, this step can be automated so that no interaction is required.\nPortnox ZTNA supports the global standards used to connect to other SSO identity providers:\nSAML – the de facto SSO standard supported by most web applications. If an app supports Entra ID or Google Workspace, it likely supports custom SAML as well.\nOIDC – an emerging SSO standard increasingly adopted by applications, though not yet as widely supported as SAML.\nEAM for Entra ID – enables support for any application with Entra ID integration, even if that application does not support custom SAML. This ensures Portnox ZTNA can secure all applications with basic SSO support when the organization uses Entra ID.\nPortnox ZTNA has been tested with over 55 popular business-oriented web applications, with Entra ID, Google Workspace, and Okta as backing identity providers for both SAML and OIDC.\nRisk assessment\nIn this section, you will learn how Portnox Cloud uses information from other risk assessment platforms for its own risk assessment policies, allowing you to rely on these platforms’ agents for risk assessment without requiring AgentP.\nPortnox AgentP is a small, non-intrusive agent, but some organizations prefer to avoid deploying additional agents due to concerns about agent overload. Portnox Cloud addresses this need by providing the option to leverage existing risk assessment platforms.\nCloud policies can be defined in detail based on AgentP’s risk assessment categories, or administrators can simply trust another agent – meaning that if a device is managed by a specific product’s agent, Portnox considers it secure and relies on that agent to take any necessary action in case of risk. This approach allows security administrators to manage policies consistently in a single platform, avoiding duplication across multiple applications.\nSupported platforms include:\nIntune\nJamf\nAbsolute Secure Endpoint\nCrowdStrike Falcon\nFor some platforms, Portnox Cloud allows policies to simply verify that a device is managed by another security platform, trusting its risk assessment and the actions specified by the administrator. In other cases, Portnox can retrieve the device’s risk score from the external system and adjust the Portnox risk score accordingly.\nPortnox continuously monitors customer needs and adds support for new platforms as required. Initially, our focus was on integrating with the best-known industry-standard solutions, ensuring broad compatibility and reliable risk assessment coverage."

  "text": "How does Portnox Cloud handle certificate revocation?\nNote: For more information about OCSP and CRL, see the following topic: Certificate revocation.\nThere are two options in Portnox Cloud for publishing revocation information for certificates:\nIf you use the Portnox root certificate and public key (default setting) to generate user/device certificates, you can include OCSP (online certificate status protocol) information with the certificate. This information is included in the Certificate Authority Information Access extension.\nTo include OCSP information with Portnox Cloud certificates, go to the section, click on the Edit link, activate the Include OCSP info checkbox, and then click on the Save button.\nIf you use the Portnox root certificate and public key (default setting) to generate user/device certificates, you can use your tenant’s CRL (certificate revocation list) hosted by Portnox.\nTo include CRL information with Portnox Cloud certificates, go to the section, click on the Edit link, activate the Include CRL info checkbox, and then click on the Save button.\nThe URL of your CRL is displayed in the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) URL field.\nIf you use your own certificate authority to generate certificates, and you publish a CRL (certificate revocation list) on your own web server, you can include the URL of that CRL when adding your own certificate.\nFollow the procedure described in the following topic: Onboard devices using your own root certificate authority. After uploading your own certificate, click on the Edit link, activate the checkbox in the CHECK REVOCATION column, and enter your CRL URL in the CUSTOM CRL URL column. Then, click on the Save link.\nTo revoke a certificate generated by Portnox Cloud, go to the Devices pane, select an account, and scroll down the right-hand side pane. If the account has a certificate that can be revoked, there is a Revoke certificate button.\nNote: The effect is not immediate. The certificate revocation lists hosted by Portnox Cloud are updated every 90 minutes.\nSCEP certificate revocation\nRevocation, invalidation, or removal of SCEP certificates is fully handled by the endpoint management software that requested the certificate from Portnox Cloud in the first place.\nThe SCEP protocol does not specify a method to request certificate revocation. Therefore, to invalidate certificates requested originally through SCEP, the endpoint management software must remove certificates that are installed on devices. For example, the Intune documentation states that SCEP certificates are removed but not revoked when using a third-party certification authority (such as Portnox Cloud)."

  "text": "How is the risk score calculated for risk assessment policies?\nThe risk score calculation begins by evaluating all attributes of the risk assessment policy.\nThe attributes can have the following scores:\nNo violation: If the condition of the attribute is met, the score of this attribute is zero.\nViolation: If the condition of the attribute is not met, the score of this attribute is the score assigned in Cloud.\nUndefined: If we cannot establish whether the condition is met or not, the score of this attribute is the score assigned in Cloud divided by 3.\nFor example:\nIf the attribute checks for an installed antivirus, and an antivirus is found on the device, the score is 0.\nIf the attribute checks for drive encryption, and the device has a non-encrypted drive, the score is as assigned in Cloud, for example, 60.\nIf the attribute checks for installed applications, but the device reports no installed application, this is deemed suspicious by Cloud and therefore the score assigned in Cloud is divided by 3. For example, if you assigned 60 to this attribute, the value of the attribute for further risk calculation is 20.\nAfter all attributes are calculated, Cloud finds the maximum value of all the attributes and that maximum is the final value for this risk assessment policy.\nFor example: If there are two attributes, one of value 40 and one of value 60, and both are found to be in violation, the final risk score is 60.\nAdditionally, the risk score calculated earlier for the same device influences the currently calculated risk score for the device according to the following formula: new_score = 0.95 * calculated_score + 0.05 * old_score"

  "text": "Enable the RADIUS Change of Authorization feature\nIn this section, you will learn how to set up your environment to let Portnox™ Cloud send RADIUS CoA packets to your NAS devices from your local LDAP Broker installation.\nNote: This method is not recommended for new installations. Portnox Cloud originally sent CoA packets only from local AD Broker installations. However, many NAS devices limit the number of RADIUS servers to three, making it impossible to use redundant Cloud RADIUS servers, a local RADIUS server, and an LDAP Broker for CoA purposes. Therefore, we recommend to use the local RADIUS server Docker container instead.\nSet up and run a local instance of the Portnox LDAP Broker. \nFollow the instructions in the relevant topic:\nIntegrate with Active Directory through LDAP Broker\nIntegrate with OpenLDAP through LDAP Broker\nNote: If you want to send CoA packets but you don’t use Active Directory or OpenLDAP, you can use the following workaround: Set up a local AD/OpenLDAP server with an empty directory and connect the LDAP Broker to that empty directory. To send CoA packets, the LDAP Broker does not need access to your corporate directory, you just need a locally running application that communicates with the Portnox Cloud. However, to install LDAP Broker, you have to connect it to a directory, and so you need the empty LDAP directory for that purpose.\nConfigure RADIUS on your NAS devices. \nAs your highest priority RADIUS server, configure the Cloud RADIUS server closest to your location. \nOptional: As your next priority RADIUS server, configure the second Cloud RADIUS server (if you selected the International (geo-redundancy) option when you created your tenant). \nOptional: As your next priority RADIUS server, configure the local RADIUS server (if you use the local RADIUS server). \nIf you need very fast response times, you can set up the local RADIUS server with higher priority than the cloud servers, but you will have less detailed logs, and any changes that you make in Portnox Cloud will be visible to your devices only upon cache expiration.\nNote: If your NAS device limits the number of RADIUS servers to three, you must skip either this step or the previous step (second Cloud RADIUS server).\nAs your lowest priority RADIUS server, configure the LDAP Broker installation as follows: \nAs the IP address of this RADIUS server, provide the IP address of the server where you installed the LDAP Broker.\nAs the authentication port and the accounting port, you can use any port numbers that are not used by the server where you installed the LDAP Broker.\nAs the shared secret, use the same shared secret as the first configured Cloud RADIUS server.\nThe LDAP Broker is not a RADIUS server, but you must configure it in the NAS device so that the NAS device can accept CoA packets coming from this server. Since you configure it with the lowest priority, the NAS device never contacts it when attempting to authenticate connections. That is why the authentication port and the accounting port are never used (they are used only if the NAS contacts the RADIUS server).\nWith this configuration, Portnox Cloud performs the following steps when you change the access policy settings:\nPortnox Cloud determines the devices that the policy settings apply to.\nThe next time that the LDAP Broker polls the cloud (default: every 30 seconds), it receives instructions to send CoA packets to specific NAS devices.\nThe LDAP Broker sends the RADIUS CoA packets to NAS devices in the local network.\nThe NAS devices react to the CoA packets by contacting Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers to re-authenticate (in order of priority configured in the NAS).\nAfter authentication, the NAS devices receive information from the RADIUS servers about VLANs/ACLs they should use."

However, using the IP address in NAS configuration is recommended.\nIn the Static IP field, enter the static local IP for your local RADIUS server. \nThis is the IP that your NAS devices will use to contact the local RADIUS server.\nIn the Netmask field, enter the netmask defining the subnet for the entered static IP address. \nIn the Gateway field, enter the default gateway IP address for the entered static IP address. \nIn the Broadcast field, enter the broadcast IP address for the subnet of the entered static IP address. \nAdd DNS servers: \nIn the Domain Name Servers (DNS) section, click on the Add DNS link to add the IP of at least one DNS resolver. \nIn the IP field, enter the IP address of the DNS resolver and click on the Add button. \nRepeat the above process if necessary by clicking on the Add DNS link to add another DNS resolver. \nYou can also click on the Remove link on the right-hand side, if you want to remove one of the added DNS resolvers.\nCopy the value of the Shared Secret field to use it when configuring NAS devices to contact this local RADIUS server. \nIf you want to generate a different shared secret, click on the Regenerate link on the right-hand side.\nNote: You can also display and copy this value later.\nOptional: In the Syslog Destination field, enter the IP and port of a local syslog server, if you want to stream logs from the virtual machine to a syslog server. \nIf you leave this field empty, Portnox Cloud will not send syslog streams. If you omit the port number, Cloud will use the default port 514.\nOptional: In the SNMP Configuration section, click on the Enable SNMP v1 and v2c checkbox to enable support for SNMP v1/v2 protocols on the local RADIUS server. \nIn the Community string field, enter the community string for this local RADIUS server. \nWrite down this community string, so you can use it later to configure other devices. The community string acts like a password/shared secret and lets other devices authenticate via SNMP v1 or v2 with the local RADIUS server.\nOptional: In the SNMP Configuration section, click on the Enable SNMP v3 checkbox to enable support for the secure SNMP v3 protocol on the local RADIUS server and provide the configuration information. \nIn the Username field, enter the SNMP v3 username. \nThe SNMP username is a unique identifier for an SNMP v3 user.\nIn the Password field, enter the SNMP v3 password. \nThe SNMP v3 password, also known as the authentication key or authentication passphrase, is a shared secret between the SNMP manager and the SNMP agent.\nIn the Authentication protocol field, select the SNMP v3 authentication protocol. \nThe authentication protocol determines the method used to authenticate the SNMP v3 user: HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA.\nIn the Privacy password field, enter the SNMP v3 privacy password. \nThe privacy password, also known as the encryption key or encryption passphrase, is used for encrypting SNMP v3 messages using symmetric encryption.\nIn the Privacy protocol field, select the SNMP v3 privacy protocol. \nThe privacy protocol is the method used to encrypt SNMP v3 messages: DES or AES 128.\nOptional: In the Fast reauthentication section, click on the Enable EAP session resumption checkbox to turn on the fast reconnect functionality. Then, if needed, change the default Session lifetime (hours) value. \nIf this setting is on, if a device loses connection to the local RADIUS server and reconnects within the session lifetime, it can authenticate quickly by providing a valid connection session ID. We recommend using this setting, along with higher priority for the local RADIUS server, for devices that need fast reconnection.\nNote: The session lifetime counts from the last successful connection, not the disconnection.\nOptional: In the Fast reauthentication section, click on the Enable Local cache checkbox to let the local RADIUS server authenticate devices on the basis of cached MAC addresses. Then, if needed, change the default Cache lifetime (hours) value. \nIf this setting is on, if a device loses connection to the local RADIUS server and reconnects within the cache lifetime, it is automatically authenticated if the local RADIUS server recognizes the MAC address. We recommend using this setting, along with higher priority for the local RADIUS server, for devices that need fast reconnection. The cache lifetime counts from the last successful connection, not the disconnection.\nNote: The local cache is a different mechanism than the primary RADIUS server cache. The primary RADIUS server cache enables clients to authenticate for up to 7 days with no connection to the Cloud RADIUS servers and this period is not configurable.

  "text": "How do RADIUS servers work in Portnox Cloud?\nIn this topic, you will learn the difference between cloud RADIUS and local RADIUS servers in Portnox™ Cloud.\nTo secure network connections, your network devices need to communicate with AAA servers. The most common protocol used by these servers is RADIUS. Portnox Cloud lets you run Cloud RADIUS servers dedicated to your organization as well as local RADIUS servers that act like proxies.\nHow do Cloud RADIUS servers work?\nPortnox Cloud has two RADIUS server farms in the Azure cloud. One in the United States and one in Netherlands.\nWhen you create your Portnox Cloud account, you select if you want to use just one of those locations (for legal reasons) or both of them. This setting cannot be changed later.\nIf you choose both locations, you can configure your NAS devices to use just one of the two servers (for example, depending on the geographical location) or both of them (for example, prioritizing the one that is closer).\nThere is no difference between the two server farms except for their location. Both farms have real-time access to all your Portnox Cloud data and both offer the same quality of service and bandwidth.\nWhen you create a Cloud RADIUS server instance, you receive a unique combination of an IP address and two port numbers. This combination is not used by any other Portnox Cloud customers – it’s an instance that is dedicated to you.\nIf you configure your NAS devices to use Cloud RADIUS servers, user/IoT devices attempting to connect to the network managed by these NAS devices will cause the NAS device to contact the Cloud RADIUS server to authenticate the user/IoT device.\nCloud RADIUS servers work for you 24/7, unless you have Internet connectivity problems. To have access to cloud RADIUS functions even when your NAS devices have no connection to the Internet, see below: How do local RADIUS servers work?\nCloud RADIUS servers work in N+2 redundancy mode. That means that there are at least 3 instances (main and two backups) running 24/7, in each of the geographical locations, to cover for any potential problems with one of the instances.\nHow do local RADIUS servers work?\nThe local RADIUS server is an optional component that you can install manually in your local network.\nThe local RADIUS can be deployed as a secure virtual machine running on Tiny Core Linux or a Docker container. When you start it, it downloads the configuration from the cloud and starts responding to RADIUS queries on configured local IP address and ports. There is no remote administration, and any changes made in the console have no effect on the server at all.\nThe local RADIUS server communicates with the activated Cloud RADIUS server that is geographically closest. For example, if you have both Cloud RADIUS servers activated and your office with the local RADIUS server is in Europe, the local RADIUS server will communicate with the European Cloud RADIUS server.\nThe local RADIUS server works as a cache. If a client device connects to the local RADIUS server and the local RADIUS server has no information about this device, it will get that information from the Cloud RADIUS. If the same client device connects to the local RADIUS server later, within the fixed cache expiration time (7 days), the local RADIUS server replies with the cached information without contacting the Cloud RADIUS. If you deploy the local RADIUS as a virtual machine, the cache is stored in persistence memory on the local drive and reloaded after a reboot (for example, if the local RADIUS server crashes or there is a power outage).\nEvery hour, the local RADIUS servers synchronize their cache with all other local RADIUS servers configured in the tenant. For example, if one local RADIUS server has cached information about a specific device, all other local RADIUS servers for the same tenant will also get cached information about this device from Cloud RADIUS. Also, during this hourly synchronization, all entries that are more than 7 days old are purged.\nWhen your local RADIUS server cannot connect to the Cloud RADIUS server (for example, during an Internet outage), your NAS devices receive only information about known devices. You cannot register any new devices in Portnox Cloud until the local RADIUS server can connect to the Cloud RADIUS server. If the local RADIUS cannot contact the cloud RADIUS server, it will not delete any cached information, and so cached information may stay in the local RADIUS cache indefinitely until a connection to the Cloud RADIUS server is reestablished.\nThe local RADIUS server also has a fast session resumption cache, with a cache lifetime that is configured when creating or editing the local RADIUS server in Portnox Cloud. This is an EAP session resumption mechanism, completely unrelated to the primary RADIUS cache function, which lets client devices resume their network connection quickly when roaming between wireless access points. This cache only stores MAC addresses of the client devices and lets you avoid the full EAP re-authentication process when reconnecting.\nYou should configure the local RADIUS on your NAS devices as first priority, higher than the priority of Cloud RADIUS server or servers. This allows the local RADIUS to act as a cache. If your NAS devices connect to the Cloud RADIUS servers and not to the local RADIUS server, there will be no cached information in the local RADIUS server in case of an outage. The downside of this setup is that you will have less detailed logs, and any changes that you make in Portnox Cloud will be visible to your devices only upon cache expiration."

If AgentP starts using computer certificates to authenticate computers, and you did not configure your computer accounts to be part of an Entra ID or Active Directory group that is mapped to a Portnox Cloud group, Portnox Cloud will assign all newly created computer accounts to the Default group. If you did not configure the Default group to allow network access, computers will lose network connectivity.\nFor more information on multi-user mode, see the following topic: AgentP and certificates.\nIntegrate Portnox Cloud with Microsoft Entra ID or local Active Directory. \nEnable AgentP multi-user mode in Portnox Cloud settings: \nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the AgentP Enrollment Policy section, click on the Edit link. Then, activate the Enable AgentP Multi-User (Windows OS only) checkbox and click on the Save button. \nNote: If you are working in a hybrid environment with Entra ID and Active Directory, by default, Portnox Cloud uses credentials from Entra ID for automatic enrollment. To use Active Directory credentials instead, activate the Prefer Active Directory over Entra ID during unattended enrollment checkbox.\nEnsure that in your Portnox Cloud group the networks are configured to use both user and computer certificates. \nDownload and install Portnox AgentP \nEnroll AgentP Automatically. \nSelect User mode, and activate the Keep automatically enrolled switch \nRun AgentP and switch the operating system user to test if AgentP changes to a different user. \nAgentP needs a few seconds to switch to a different user.

  "text": "Turn on MAC address spoofing protection by IoT fingerprinting\nIn this topic, you will learn how to turn on and use MAC address spoofing protection in Portnox™ Cloud.\nMAC spoofing is a malicious attack method in which the attacker modifies an Ethernet interface’s MAC address on their device to correspond with another device’s MAC address. If certain devices on your network are authorized based only on their MAC addresses, the attacker can unplug the approved device from the network and connect their own device, gaining the same level of network access as the original device.\nPortnox Cloud MAC-based authentication detects such attacks and can either raise an alert or disconnect the rogue device. Portnox Cloud functionality called IoT fingerprinting records the device DHCP fingerprint, which is unique, and then checks if the device has the same fingerprinting when connecting again.\nFor IoT fingerprinting to work, the device must use DHCP to request an IP address, and you must have a DHCP forwarder on the same subnet. When the device connects to the network, it broadcasts its DHCP request in the subnet. The DHCP forwarder picks up the broadcast and forwards it to the Portnox Cloud IoT fingerprinting servers.\nTurn on IoT fingerprinting\nIn this section, you will turn on the IoT fingerprinting functionality in Portnox Cloud™, which is necessary for MAC spoofing protection to work.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nIn the right-hand side pane, under the Agentless IoT Device Fingerprinting heading, click on the Edit link. \nClick on the Enable Agentless IoT Device Fingerprinting checkbox to activate it, and then click on the Save button to save the configuration. \nTurn on MAC spoofing protection\nIn this section, you will turn on the MAC spoofing protection for a specific Portnox Cloud™ MAC-based account.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Devices option. \nClick on the row that represents a MAC-based account and then click on the Edit button above to edit the account settings. \nOn the account settings screen, scroll down to the IoT Device Trust section, activate the Enable IoT Device Trust checkbox, and then click on the Save account button in the top-right corner of the screen. \nThe IoT Device Trust (MAC spoofing protection) functionality can function in one of two different modes:\nSend a warning alert if this account is suspected of being the victim of MAC spoofing. Devices under this account will still be allowed access to the corporate network.\nBlock devices from accessing the corporate network and send an alert if this account is the victim of MAC spoofing.\nIn this example, we’re using alerts only. To use the second option and block devices from accessing the network, you need to enable the RADIUS Change of Authorization feature by following the steps in this topic: Enable the RADIUS Change of Authorization feature.\nSet up the DHCP forwarder\nIn this section, we will set up a DHCP forwarder to forward DHCP broadcasts to the Portnox™ Cloud IoT fingerprinting servers.\nNote: If you are worried that forwarding DHCP packets without encryption may be a security risk, note that a DHCP request contains no sensitive information. DHCP requests are broadcast traffic that goes to every endpoint on the network segment. This is true of any network that client accesses, including any hotspots. The only possible identifying information would be the MAC address, but MAC addresses are not truly unique and cannot be used to identify the user or organization. Therefore, DHCP forwarding is not a security risk.\nYou have two options to set up a DHCP forwarder:\nIf you have a Layer 3 device such as a router and this device has DHCP forwarder functionality, you can set this device to forward DHCP broadcasts to the Cloud IoT fingerprinting servers. The device must be connected to the same subnet as the devices to be fingerprinted. If you choose this option, follow the device manufacturer instructions to set up DHCP forwarding and forward all DHCP requests to one or both of the following IP addresses on port 67:\n20.241.131.45 if you use the United States RADIUS server\n20.4.128.229 if you use the Europe RADIUS server\nNote: The device that acts as a DHCP forwarder cannot act as a DHCP server at the same time.\nIf you do not have a Layer 3 device that can be used for DHCP forwarding, you can set up a physical or virtual machine on the same subnet to act as a forwarder. Portnox provides a Docker container with all the necessary functionality.\nYou can also use the Portnox DHCP forwarder if your firewall blocks port 67. The forwarder communicates with the Portnox Cloud servers on port 167 instead.\nIn this example, we show you how to configure the Portnox DHCP forwarder Docker container on an Ubuntu virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox.\nInstall Docker on the virtual machine, if not yet installed. \n$ sudo apt install docker.io\nImportant: While the Ubuntu apt repository includes Docker, for production machines Docker recommends using its own apt repository instead. This gives you access to newer versions and additional packages. You can find the relevant instructions in the official Docker documentation.\nImportant: If Docker is already installed, skip this step. If you don’t have a physical or virtual machine to install Docker, you can get a third-party Linux image. For example, you can download the latest Ubuntu image from the Linux VM Images project and import it into your hypervisor.\nPull the Portnox DHCP forwarder Docker image. \n$ sudo docker pull portnox/portnox-dhcp\nRun the Portnox DHCP forwarder. \nsudo docker run -d --read-only --net=host \\ --name portnox-dhcp-relay portnox/portnox-dhcp:latest \\ -i eth0 -r 20.4.128.229:167\nNote: In this example, the forwarder is sending the data to the European Portnox IoT fingerprinting server. Use the following IP address and port to forward to the United States server instead: 20.241.131.45:167.\nOptional: Monitor the Portnox DHCP forwarder logs. \n$ sudo docker logs portnox-dhcp-relay -f\nOptional: To automatically update the Portnox DHCP forwarded to the newest version as soon as it is available, install the portnox-autoupdate Docker container, as instructed in the following topic: Automatic updates for all Docker containers. \nTest the forwarder connection\nIn this section, you will use the Packet Sender application to test the connection between the forwarder and Portnox Cloud IoT fingerprinting servers.\nTo make sure that your forwarder can connect to the Portnox Cloud servers, or to troubleshoot IoT fingerprinting problems, we recommend that you test if the UDP packets are reaching their destination. For this, we recommend that you use the open-source Packet Sender application.\nIn this example, we will install the Packet Sender application on the Ubuntu virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox. This is the same machine that is running the DHCP forwarder.\nInstall Packet Sender. \n$ sudo apt install snapd $ sudo snap install packetsender\nRun Packet Sender. \nSend an echo UDP packet to the Portnox Cloud IoT fingerprinting server. \nIn the ASCII field, type echo. \nIn the Address field, enter the Portnox Cloud IP that you want to test (20.241.131.45 or 20.4.128.229). \nIn the Port field, enter 167. \nNote: You can also use Packet Sender to test the connection to port 67, if you want to use a physical device as your DHCP forwarder.\nSelect UDP as the packet type. \nClick on the Send button. \nObserve the log section below. \nYou should see two entries: one will be the packet that you sent, and the other will be the echo reply. If you only see one entry, port 167 is probably blocked on your firewall.\nTest the MAC spoofing protection\nIn this section, you will attempt MAC spoofing to test if Portnox MAC spoofing protection is working correctly.\nTo test MAC spoofing protection, you need two devices and you need to know how to change the MAC address of the second device to mimic the MAC address of the first device. In this example, we used a macOS laptop as the original device, and a Windows laptop as the spoofed device.\nFind the MAC address of the Ethernet interface of the first device. \nIn this example, we used a macOS device, and checked the MAC address by using System Preferences: \nThe discovered MAC address is: 24:1B:7A:F9:5B:DC.\nAdd the MAC address of the Ethernet interface to the MAC-based account. \nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Devices option. \nClick on the row that represents a MAC-based account and then click on the Edit button above to edit the account settings. \nIn the Allowed MAC addresses section, click on the Add new MAC address link. \nIn the CREATE NEW MAC ADDRESS window, enter the MAC address of the test device with a description that lets you easily identify and remove it later. Then, click on the Save button. \nFor example, add the MAC address 24:1B:7A:F9:5B:DC with a description: MAC spoofing test.\nClick on the Save account button in the top-right corner of the screen. \nConnect the first device to the switch and check for an alert on the Portnox Cloud Alerts screen. \nChange the MAC address of the Ethernet adapter of the second device. \nIn this example, we used a Windows laptop, and changed the MAC address to the MAC address of the first device (24:1B:7A:F9:5B:DC) by doing the following:\nIn the search bar, start typing network connections and select the View network connections option above. \nRight-click on the icon that represents the Ethernet interface and select the Properties option from the context menu. \nIn the Ethernet Properties window, click on the Configure button. \nIn the Ethernet adapter Properties window, go to the Advanced tab. \nIn the Property list, find the Locally Administered Address entry, click on it, and in the Value field on the right-hand side, enter the MAC address to spoof. \nFor example: 241B7AF95BDC\nConnect the spoofed device to the switch and check for an alert on the Portnox Cloud Alerts screen."

  "text": "Types of certificates\nIn this topic, you will learn about the different types of certificates that are used by Portnox™ Cloud to secure communications.\nBefore you begin, if you are new to the subject of digital certificates, please watch our introductory video:\nDigital certificates are used to make sure a system on the network is real and trustworthy. In Portnox Cloud, two separate certificates and certificate chains serve two purposes: \nThe root CA certificate and the RADIUS certificate: To prove to NAS devices and user devices that the Cloud RADIUS servers are authentic.\nThe tenant CA certificate and the user/device certificates: To prove to the Cloud RADIUS server that the user and/or device are authentic and can access the network securely.\nThe root CA certificate\nIn this section, we explain the function of the root CA certificate.\nRoot CA (Certificate Authority) certificates are at the top of the hierarchical structure of digital certificates used in the public key infrastructure (PKI). A Root CA is a highly trusted entity that issues digital certificates to intermediate CAs (Certificate Authorities) or directly to end entities such as the Portnox Cloud. These certificates are then used to verify the authenticity of the entities they certify.\nRoot CA certificates are pre-installed and trusted by default in web browsers, operating systems, and other applications, and any certificate issued by them is automatically trusted by those systems. However, older systems may not have all the root CA certificates, such as the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 used by Portnox Cloud. That is why Cloud provides you with this CA certificate to download and install on such systems.\nIf your system is old and it does not have the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 CA certificate installed, it will not be able to verify the identity of the Cloud RADIUS server, which will generate warnings, and in some systems it can even prevent you from using Portnox Cloud.\nYou can download the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 certificate here: , or directly from our documentation server, or directly from DigiCert.\nThe Cloud RADIUS certificate\nIn this section, we explain the function of the Cloud RADIUS certificate.\nThe Cloud RADIUS certificate is signed using the root CA certificate. Portnox purchases this certificate annually from DigiCert to guarantee the authenticity of its RADIUS servers, which use the domain name clear-rad.portnox.com.\nNote: If you verify the authenticity of the RADIUS server using the root CA certificate, then you do not need to use the RADIUS certificate. We strongly recommend that you use the root CA certificate instead of the Cloud RADIUS certificate. This is because the Cloud RADIUS certificate has a shorter validity period (1 year only), and this means you will have to reconfigure your network for the updated certificate once a year, which could also cause temporary connectivity problems for your users.\nIf you need to use the RADIUS server certificate for any purpose, contact us at success@portnox.com to receive the certificate file.\nThe SCEP server’s intermediate certificate\nIn this section, we explain the function of the SCEP server’s intermediate certificate.\nYou can use the Portnox Cloud SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) server to request certificates for your devices. The SCEP protocol works through HTTP/HTTPS requests and is mainly used by UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) and MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions.\nMost device operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and iOS, by default use SCEP via HTTP requests. However, some device operating systems such as Android require SCEP via HTTPS requests. To make such requests, the devices must have the SCEP server’s intermediate certificate to validate the SCEP server’s identity.\nThe Portnox Cloud SCEP server’s intermediate certificate is the Thawte TLS RSA CA G1 certificate. In many cases, the operating system of the device already has this standard certificate installed, and you don’t need to upload it to the device. However, it is safer to distribute the certificate using your UEM/MDM solution to make sure that every device can connect using SCEP via HTTPS.\nIf you need to use the SCEP server’s intermediate certificate to your UEM/MDM software configuration profiles, you can download it directly from our documentation server. Alternatively, you can download it from the DigiCert website.\nThe tenant CA certificate\nIn this section, we explain the function of the tenant CA certificate.\nThe tenant CA certificate is a root certificate, which means that it has no chain of signatures. It is completely independent of the root CA certificate. The tenant CA certificate is a self-signed certificate for the tenant-specific CA that is used by Portnox Cloud to authenticate your users and devices, and you should not use it for any other purpose.\nIf your organization has its own certificate authority and you want to use this CA to generate user and device certificates, you can replace the default tenant CA certificate generated by Portnox Cloud with your own CA certificate. Then, you will need to use your own CA to generate device/user certificates, and Cloud will use the uploaded tenant CA certificate to confirm if they are genuine and use them to verify users/devices.\nYou can download the tenant CA certificate or upload your own CA certificate here: .\nThe user/device certificates\nIn this section, we explain the function of the user and device certificates, also known as supplicant certificates.\nThe user/device (supplicant) certificates are signed by the tenant CA, so they have the tenant CA certificate as the root of their signature chain. This can be either the default tenant CA provided by Portnox Cloud or your own CA.\nIf you use the default tenant CA provided by Portnox Cloud, you can have Cloud generate all user and device certificates for you. This is possible because then Cloud has access to the certificate’s private key, which is needed to sign other certificates. You can, for example, ask your users to use the self-service onboarding portal to generate and download these certificates for their devices.\nIf you use your own CA that you uploaded to Portnox Cloud, then Cloud cannot generate user/device certificates because it does not have the private key. Only you have the private key because it is your certificate authority. You have to generate all user/device certificates yourself and distribute them to your users’ devices, for example, using unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions such as Intune.\nCertificate formats\nIn this section, we explain the common certificate formats used in Portnox Cloud and during onboarding.\nAll of the certificates mentioned above can be saved in various formats. In some cases, such as with endpoint management systems, you might need to convert your certificate to a different format. The three most common formats used in Portnox Cloud and onboarded devices are:\nBase-64 encoded X.509 / Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM): This is the most common format for X.509 certificates, which is a Base-64 encoded text file. To check if your certificate is in this format, you can simply open it in a text editor. If you see the BEGIN CERTIFICATE header, it means the certificate is in the PEM format. This format is sometimes called Privacy-Enhanced Mail, because it was originally developed to secure email communications.\nNote that despite the name of the format, PEM certificates are very often stored with the .crt or .cer extension, which are also used by the DER format described below, instead of the .pem extension. Some systems will even reject PEM certificates with the .pem extension. Therefore, you should not use the extension to determine the format of the file.\nX.509 DER encoded binary: This is the binary format of X.509 certificates that is also commonly used. The certificate is stored in the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format, which is part of the X.690 standard.\nNote that despite the name of the format, DER certificates are very often stored with the .cer or .crt extension, which is also used by the PEM format described below, instead of the .der extension. Some systems will even reject DER certificates with the .der extension. Therefore, you should not use the extension to determine the format of the file.\nThe rootCertificate.cer file available in Portnox Cloud for the root CA certificate is in the X.509 DER encoded binary format.\nPKCS #12: This is an archive file format for storing many cryptography objects in a single file. It is often used to combine the X.509 certificate with its corresponding private key, or to bundle all the members of the chain of trust. Many systems do not accept this format and you may need to convert the certificate to one of the two previously mentioned formats. Systems that accept the PKCS #12 format often do not accept private keys with empty passwords.\nThe most common extension for PKCS #12 files is .pfx but the extension .p12 is also used.\nThe file available in Portnox Cloud for the tenant CA certificate is in the PKCS #12 format bundled with the corresponding private key, which has an empty password.\nPKCS #7: This is a standard commonly used to bundle multiple certificates together, for example, to include a certificate and its chain of trust. This format does not store private keys.\nThe most common extension for PKCS #7 files is .p7b or .p7c.\nIn Portnox Cloud, you can use this format to import your own CA certificate as the tenant CA certificate together with any intermediate certificates if you use them to sign the supplicant certificates.\nCertificate exportability\nIn this section, we explain whether certificates generated by Portnox Cloud for users/devices can be copied to other devices.\nWhen Portnox Cloud generates a certificate for the user or device, and then AgentP or the user installs that certificate on a device, it is actually not just the certificate but a certificate-key pair: private key and the corresponding certificate (public key). Both parts are needed for authentication.\nThe certificate (public key) can always be exported. However, operating systems allow the users and applications to install the private key as exportable or non-exportable.\nIf the private key is exportable, it means that you can export it to a file.\nIf a private key is non-exportable, it means that you cannot export it to a file and, for example, copy to another device.\nThis means that if the private key is installed as non-exportable, you cannot copy it to any other device. For example, you cannot export it from the device’s operating system and upload to another device. If you export and copy just the certificate, without the private key, authentication will not work.\nAgentP certificates\nAgentP installs all private keys in non-exportable mode. That means that certificate-key pairs managed by AgentP are secure and cannot be copied by the user to another device.\nBelow is an example of the Windows certificate export screen for a certificate installed by AgentP. As you can see, the private key export option is not available.\nSelf-onboarding certificates\nCertificate-key pairs obtained through the self-onboarding portal must be installed by the user:\nYou access the self-onboarding portal, log in with your company credentials, and request a certificate to be generated.\nYour browser downloads the .p12 certificate-key pair file to your local drive.\nWhen you install this file, you add the certificate and the private key to the operating system’s certificate store.\nUnfortunately, during the installation of the certificate-key pair, the user can choose the option to install the private key as exportable:\nIf the user selects this option, the private key can later be saved to a file and copied to another device. Also, the user can copy the .p12 file to another device, and install it there. That is why AgentP is the recommended, more secure certificate management method as it prevents the user from reusing the same certificate on several devices.\nTrusted certificate server names\nIn this section, we explain why configurations optionally ask for a trusted certificate server name.\nWhen you select the certificate to verify the authenticity of the Cloud RADIUS servers, either in your operating system or in an UEM solution, you usually also have an option to trust a specific domain name. This option may be called Connect to these servers (in Windows), Certificate server names (in Intune), Trusted certificate server names (in macOS/iOS/Jamf) or Server Certificate Names (in Kandji).\nThis is an optional, extra security measure. Is not necessary, but it is recommended. It means that your operating system or your UEM software, once it verifies the validity of the certificate, checks who the certificate was issued to and compares it with the domain name that you provided. In such case, if you provide the domain name clear-rad.portnox.com, your operating system or UEM solution will confirm that the Cloud RADIUS server certificate is issued to this domain name (by checking the certificate’s Subject field), which adds an extra layer of security.\nNote: This option does not replace validating the certificate and is/should be used for extra security purposes only.\nCertificate identity information\nIn this section, we explain the importance of the identity information in the certificate, where such information is stored, and how to change the storage location.\nWhen a supplicant device presents its certificate to the Portnox Cloud RADIUS server (or other Cloud services such as Zero Trust Network Access), Portnox Cloud needs to identify the owner of the certificate. The certificate itself does not inherently contain identifying information, similar to an ID document that cannot have just a fingerprint; it must also include the owner's name for proper identification.\nCertificates have special fields that can be used to contain such information and any additional information that is required. The primary field is the Subject field, which is present in every certificate, and is usually filled with some kind of identification information. For example, for website certificates, the Subject field contains the URL of the website. However, there is an option to include more such information in certificates, and it’s called Subject Alternative Names (SAN). SAN is not just one field but rather a whole system of adding extra fields that can contain email addresses, DNS names, and much more. The most common field, used by Portnox Cloud to store the identify information is called the User Principal Name (SAN UPN).\nHowever, if you use your own tenant CA certificates instead of the ones generated by Portnox Cloud, and manage your supplicant certificates using your own CA rather than Portnox Cloud with AgentP or SCEP, you may prefer to store user identity information in a different field within the certificate. In this case, Portnox Cloud provides an option to specify where the RADIUS server should look for user identity information within the certificate: .\nIn this section, you can select more than one field that is to be checked for user identity information, and you can also drag the fields up or down to define the order in which they are to be checked.\nWarning: Do not use this setting if you are using the default Portnox Cloud tenant CA and AgentP to manage your supplicant certificates. Regardless of the option selected, when AgentP generates the certificates, the user identity information will always be stored in the SAN UPN field.\nImportant: This setting only affects where the Cloud RADIUS server checks for user identity information. For other services, such as Zero Trust Network Access, this setting does not apply, and user identity information must be stored in the SAN UPN field. For device-based certificates, such as those used for kiosks, this setting also does not apply, and device identifiers should always be stored in the SAN DNS field to be recognized by Portnox Cloud.\nNote: You can use this setting if you generate user certificates with a UEM solution and configure your SCEP profiles to store identity information in other fields, though this is not recommended. We advise configuring your user SCEP profiles to use the SAN UPN field and only adjusting this option if your UEM solution does not support the SAN UPN field.\nCertificate revocation\nIn this section, we explain what is certificate revocation and how Portnox Cloud handles certificate revocation.\nA certificate can become invalid in two ways:\nIf its expiration date passes.\nIf it is manually revoked.\nThe certificate’s expiration date is stored within the certificate itself, so it’s easy for the device’s operating system or an application to compare this date with the current date to determine if the certificate is still valid.\nHowever, if the certificate is manually revoked, this action occurs on the issuer’s side, not on the device. For example, if Portnox Cloud generates a certificate for a device and the administrator later decides to revoke it, this revocation is recorded in Portnox Cloud, not directly on the device.\nSo, how can the device’s operating system or an application such as AgentP check if the certificate is still valid?\nPortnox Cloud supports two methods for this verification:\nCRL: certificate revocation lists\nIn this method, the certificate issuer creates a list of all the certificate serial numbers that have been revoked. The operating system can download and view this list over a regular HTTP connection (it can even be opened in a browser) to see if a specific certificate is included. If the certificate is on the list, it is revoked; if it’s not on the list, it is still valid.\nThis method is simple and widely supported around the world. However, it has a drawback: if the issuer issues and cancels many certificates (such as thousands each day, like some large enterprises), the list can get very long. This may slow down the download process, making it take longer for the system to check the certificates.\nThis is an example of a CRL URL included in a Portnox Cloud certificate:\nThis is an example of a CRL list (.crl file) downloaded from Portnox Cloud and opened in Windows:\nOCSP: online certificate status protocol\nThis is a newer method, but it is not as widely supported as the CRL method. With OCSP, each certificate has a specific URL that can be queried to check if it is still valid. When a device needs to check a certificate’s status, it sends a request to this URL with the certificate’s serial number. The server then responds with the current status of that specific certificate.\nBecause the OCSP response only covers one certificate, it is much smaller and faster to process than a full CRL file, making it more efficient when many certificates are revoked.\nNote: OCSP requests and responses use a binary format, so they can only be processed by the operating system or certain applications.\nThis is an example of an OCSP URL included in a Portnox Cloud certificate:\nTo see how to configure CRL and OSCP in Portnox Cloud, see the following topic: How does Portnox Cloud handle certificate revocation?."

Check your group configuration. 802.1X access attempt denied due to expired credentials This alert can occur under two circumstances: either the Portnox account for the device had an expiration date that has passed, or the wireless adapter of an AgentP device is configured to use MSCHAPv2 authentication, and AgentP was unable to update the credentials for some reason. 802.1X access attempt denied due to Google Workspace account misconfiguration An attempt to access the network using 802.1X authentication was denied because the Less secure app access option is disabled in Google Workspace for the user, preventing credential validation during authentication. To resolve this, enable the Less secure app access option as outlined in the documentation. 802.1X access attempt denied due to MFA policy An attempt to access the network using 802.1X authentication was denied because the account is an Okta-based account, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled in Okta, and the authentication attempt does not include MFA. 802.1X access attempt denied due to missing credentials An attempt to access the network using 802.1X credential-based authentication was denied because the supplicant device provided no credentials. Check your supplicant device network configuration. 802.1X access attempt denied due to missing supplicant certificate An attempt to access the network using 802.1X EAP-TLS authentication was denied because no supplicant certificate was provided by the supplicant device. Check your supplicant device network configuration. 802.1X access attempt denied due to supplicant certificate invalid An attempt to access the network using 802.1X EAP-TLS authentication was denied because the data in the supplicant’s certificates (Subject/SAN) did not match any devices or accounts in Portnox Cloud. To resolve this, ensure that the supplicant certificate is issued with the correct Subject/SAN information. This error is most common if SCEP details are not configured correctly in UEM software. For more information, refer to a topic for your UEM software in the onboarding section. 802.1X access attempt denied due to supplicant certificate issuer untrusted An attempt to access the network using 802.1X EAP-TLS authentication was denied because the supplicant’s certificates were not issued by any root authorities trusted by the organization. This can occur, for example, if the supplicant’s certificate used in EAP-TLS was issued by a different root Certificate Authority (CA) than the one configured in Portnox Cloud. To resolve this, verify that your supplicant certificate is issued by the same root CA as the one configured in Cloud. For more information about certificates, refer to the following topic: Types of certificates. 802.1X access attempt denied due to supplicant certificate untrusted An attempt to access the network using 802.1X EAP-TLS authentication was denied because the supplicant’s certificate failed the trust validation. This can happen if one of the certificates in the supplicant’s trust chain is not recognized. To resolve the issue, ensure that if you’re using your own Certificate Authority (CA) to generate certificates, all certificates in the chain (including intermediate ones) are added to the Cloud configuration. For more information on certificates, refer to the following topic: Types of certificates. 802.1X access attempt denied due to unsupported authentication type An attempt to access the network using 802.1X authentication was denied because the supplicant device used an unsupported authentication type. This commonly occurs when a supplicant device is configured to use MSCHAPv2 authentication, but the authentication repository is Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta Workforce Identity, which do not support MSCHAPv2. For more information, refer to relevant onboarding section topics for your operating system. 802.1X access attempt denied due to wrong credentials An attempt to access the network using 802.1X credential-based authentication was denied due to incorrect credentials. Verify if the user’s password in the authentication repository has changed, and update the supplicant device configuration with the new password if necessary. For more information, refer to relevant onboarding section topics for your operating system. 802.1X access attempt denied to unauthorized SSID The supplicant device attempted to access a Wi-Fi network with the specified SSID using 802.1X, but the attempt was denied because the account belongs to a group that is restricted from Wi-Fi access. Check your group configuration. 802.1X authentication success The device was successfully authenticated and is now connected to the network. This alert is for information purposes only and requires no action. 802.1X wired access attempt denied An attempt to access the network using 802.1X was denied because the group that the user/device belongs to does not allow for wired network authentication. Check your group configuration. 802.1X wired access attempt denied due to forbidden authentication type An attempt to access the 801.X wired network was denied because the authentication type used in the attempt is not allowed for the group (Groups > group_name > 802.1X Wired network access > Allowed authentication types). 802.1X wireless access attempt denied due to forbidden authentication type An attempt to access the 801.X wireless network was denied because the authentication type used in the attempt is not allowed for the group (Groups > group_name > 802.1X Wireless network access > network_name > Allowed authentication types). Access denied since Directory Broker does not respond 802.1X access was denied because the Portnox LDAP Broker is not responding, so access to the organization’s Active Directory is not possible. To troubleshoot connectivity issues, see the following topic: How to check if the LDAP Broker connects to the cloud. Access denied - user name ambiguous The user provided only their username without the domain part, and there are multiple users with the same username across different repositories. As a result, Portnox Cloud cannot uniquely assign the user to a specific repository. Access is denied due to the organization exceeding its subscription plan quota Access was denied because the subscription plan quota have been exceeded. Contact your Portnox representative for options to extend your quota. Access requests become to be served by Portnox Cloud service Access to the Cloud RADIUS server has been restored. As a result, all access requests are now being forwarded by the local RADIUS server to the Cloud RADIUS server and are being handled by the Cloud RADIUS server.

  "text": "Integrate with Active Directory\nIn this topic, you will learn how to integrate Portnox™ Cloud with a local Active Directory (AD) instance using the Portnox LDAP Broker.\nMake sure that you have at least one Windows server (physical or virtual), which has access to the local Active Directory, and where you can install the Portnox LDAP Broker.\nWarning: If you integrate your Portnox Cloud with both Entra ID and Active Directory, the Entra ID integration takes precedence in case of devices that are enrolled in both directories. This means that if a device is found in Entra ID, Portnox Cloud will not even check for its existence in Active Directory. This is because in Portnox Cloud, an account representing a device can only be associated with one directory at a time.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nUnder the DIRECTORY INTEGRATION SERVICE section, click on the Add new domain link. \nIn the User repository type field, select the Active Directory option. \nIn the Display name field, type a display name for your configuration. \nIn the Base DN field, type the Distinguished Name (DN) of the starting point for directory server searches. \nDistinguished Names are in the X.500 Directory Services format of Domain Components (DC). To convert a domain name to Domain Components, split the domain name at the period, and create a dc= entry for each part. For example, for the domain vorlon.com, the DN would be dc=vorlon,dc=com.\nIn the Domain names section, click on the Add new domain name link. \nIn the Domain name field, type the domain name controlled by your local domain controller and click on the Add button. \nIn the Domain controllers (DC) field, click on the Add new Domain Controller link. \nIn the Host and Port fields, enter the IP address of your domain controller and the port number, and then click on the Save button. \nThe typical port numbers are 389 for non-encrypted connections and 636 for SSL/TLS connections. If you want to use SSL/TLS connections to connect to your domain controllers, select the Use SSL checkbox below.\nNote: There are two standards of SSL/TLS connections with LDAP, LDAPS (LDAP over SSL) and STARTTLS (LDAP over TLS). Portnox Cloud uses the LDAPS (LDAP over SSL) standard.\nClick on the Save button below to save your configuration. \nCreate credentials to access Portnox Cloud from external services. \nNote: Skip this step, if you already created the credentials for another purpose earlier.\nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nClick on the Generate Credentials link. \nCheck your email. You will receive the credentials by email. \nNote: Preferably, check the email on the device where you will be installing the broker or copy the information from the email to a file on that device.\nDownload, install, and configure the Portnox LDAP Broker software. \nNote: The Portnox LDAP Broker is available for Windows only.\nSwitch to the device or virtual machine where you will install the broker. \nLog in to Portnox Cloud and go to the screen. \nIn the DIRECTORY INTEGRATION SERVICE section, scroll down to the Download Portnox Cloud Directory Broker section, and click on the Download link. \nRun the broker installation file PortnoxADBroker.exe and click on the Next button. \nPaste the credentials from the email received earlier into the fields in the broker installation window and click on the Next button. \nOptional: If you have more than one domain configured in Portnox Cloud, in the Provide Active Directory domain step, select the domain for this LDAP Broker. \nNote: LDAP Broker can only service a single directory domain at a time. If you have more than one directory domain, you need a separate LDAP Broker for each domain.\nIn the Provide Directory Controller Credentials step, input the credentials for a domain controller user account and click on the Next button. \nNote: These are credentials for a user account that exists in your domain controller, not in Portnox Cloud. For security, we recommend that you create a separate user in your domain controller, who only has read access and is only used by the broker.\nOptional: Click on the Test button to test your configuration. \nWarning: The testing process may create an extra entry in your list of LDAP Brokers in Portnox Cloud. If so, you can simply delete the extra entry. You can recognize the entry because it has no IP address listed, its state is Not updated, and its version number is 1.1.1. \nAfter the installation completes, click on the Finish button. \nOptional: If you want to configure your Active Directory or OpenLDAP integration or set additional options, read the following topic: Edit your AD/OpenLDAP integration. \nResult: You can authenticate devices on your network using your local Active Directory.\nFor troubleshooting, see the following FAQ topic: How to check if the LDAP Broker connects to the cloud\nImportant: You can install any number of LDAP Broker instances on any number of machines. If there is more than one LDAP Broker configured for your domain, and there is an authentication request for that domain, Portnox Cloud sends that request to all LDAP Brokers that you configured for that domain. The first LDAP Broker that responds is the one that is used for this specific request."

Copy the value of its Location attribute (without the quotes). \nIn the Portnox tab, in the Resource properties section, click on the empty field under the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL / Reply URL heading and paste the copied value. \nFinalize the configuration\nIn this section, you will finalize the configuration in Portnox Cloud and SOTI ONE.\nFinalize the configuration in the Portnox tab. \nOptional: Click on the Next button, and in the Policy enforcement section, in the Device risk assessment section, change the setting to Override with custom policy and then select a risk assessment policy if you want to assess risk with this application using a custom risk assessment policy, and in the Access control section, change the setting to Override with custom policy and then select an access control policy if you want to control access to this application using a custom access control policy. \nScroll all the way down to the end of the page, and then click on the Add resource button. \nFinalize the configuration in the SOTI tab. \nClick on the Create button to create the directory in SOTI. \nIn your SOTI ONE dashboard, click on the ≡ icon in the top-left corner, and then select the Users option from the menu. \nIn the Directory selector, select the directory/IdP that you created earlier in SOTI ONE. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the NEW USER GROUP button. \nIn the ADD IDP USER GROUP window, click on the + icon, enter the group NAME, optionally activate the IDENTITY ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATOR switch (if applicable), and click on the ADD button. \nNote: If you use the user.groups claim in Entra ID, in the NAME field, enter the group’s Object ID, not the human-readable Entra ID Name.\nNote: All users from your selected domain who are assigned to this group in your identity provider will be authorized to use SOTI ONE. You may want to create at least two groups, one with administrative access and the other for regular users.\nResult: You have configured SOTI ONE to be accessible using Portnox Zero Trust Network Access."

This configuration and this template will be used by the profiles that you will create later.\nNote: If you already created Workspace ONE UEM profiles for other operating systems, you do not need to create a new SCEP CA configuration. However, you may need to create a new SCEP request template, if you use device-based profiles, and if the device identification for this operating system uses different authentication repository properties than other operating systems.\nOpen your Workspace ONE UEM tenant dashboard in your browser, and log in as the administrator. \nIn the Certificate Authorities pane, click on the Add button. \nIn the Certificate Authority – Add/Edit pane: \nIn the Name field, enter a name for this configuration. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Authority Type field, select the Generic SCEP option. \nIn the SCEP URL field, paste the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Static Challenge and Confirm Challenge Phrase fields, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nClick on the TEST CONNECTION button to test your configuration. \nYou should get a message Test is successful.

This will let Portnox Cloud create Cloud accounts for new devices, and the value of this variable will be used as the name for such accounts. In this case, new Portnox accounts for new devices will be named after the device’s serial number so you can identify the devices in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Private Key Length field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Private Key Type field, select both checkboxes. \nOptional: In the SAN Type field, click on the +Add button to add a new SAN entry.

If you are using device-based certificates, you can skip this step because Portnox Cloud creates device-based Portnox accounts using the value in the Subject field, not the SAN field.\nThe variable in this field must match a value from the authentication repository in Portnox Cloud, which uniquely identifies the user or the device. This is the value on the basis of which the Portnox Cloud SCEP server will know for which user or device it should issue a certificate.\nIn this example, we used the variable {EmailAddress}, which generates the UPN SAN on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn the Automatic Certificate Renewal field, we recommend that you select the ENABLED option and in the Publish Private Key field, we recommend that you select the DISABLED option. \nThese values will not directly affect the integration.

Without it, the user would see a security warning.\nIn the bottom-right corner of the Add a New Windows Desktop Profile pane, click on the SAVE AND PUBLISH button. \nIn the View Device Assignment window, confirm if the profile will be pushed to correct devices, and then click on the PUBLISH button. \nResult: You created a device profile for Portnox Cloud and Windows devices.\nAfter you created your profiles, you can use your regular Workspace ONE UEM procedures to push them to managed computers immediately and see if they work correctly. For information on managing computers, pushing profiles, and troubleshooting, consult the Workspace ONE UEM documentation.\nImportant: For Windows desktops, Workspace ONE UEM does not support wired network profiles, only Wi-Fi profiles. Support for wired profiles is currently available in the Workspace ONE UEM Beta programme. Until this support is available for all Workspace ONE UEM instances, the workaround is to manually configure a device to connect to the wired LAN without Workspace ONE UEM, use the netsh command to export a lan.xml file, and then use that XML file as a custom XML payload in Workspace ONE UEM."

If you are using device-based certificates, you can skip this step because Portnox Cloud creates device-based Portnox accounts using the value in the Subject field, not the SAN field.\nThe variable in this field must match a value from the authentication repository in Portnox Cloud, which uniquely identifies the user or the device. This is the value on the basis of which the Portnox Cloud SCEP server will know for which user or device it should issue a certificate.\nIn this example, we used the variable {EmailAddress}, which generates the UPN SAN on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn the Automatic Certificate Renewal field, we recommend that you select the ENABLED option and in the Publish Private Key field, we recommend that you select the DISABLED option. \nThese values will not directly affect the integration. They apply to your certificate renewal management and security preferences. Adjust them to your needs, if necessary.\nClick on the SAVE button to save the template. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA and the SCEP request template.\nCreate a profile for macOS\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Workspace ONE UEM for macOS devices. This profile will contain the necessary certificates as well as SCEP, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet configurations.\nIn the Profiles pane, click on the Add button and select the Add Profile option. \nIn the Add Profile pane, click on the Apple macOS icon. \nIn the Select Context pane, click on the User icon. \nIn the General tab, in the Name field, enter a name for the profile and configure other options as required by your organization policies. \nNote: In the Smart Groups field, make sure to select the correct group to push this profile to correct devices.\nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud macOS Profile, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the SCEP option, and then click on the Configure button in the right-hand side pane. \nIn the SCEP pane: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Defined Certificate Authority option. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP CA configuration you created earlier. \nIn the Certificate Template field, select the name of the SCEP request template you created earlier. \nDeactivate the Allow export of private key from Keychain checkbox. \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the Credentials option, and then click on the Configure button in the right-hand side pane. \nIn the Credentials pane, configure the following payload: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Upload option. \nIn the Certificate section, click on the UPLOAD button and select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier. \nDeactivate the Allow export of private key from Keychain checkbox. \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the Network option, and then click on the Configure button in the right-hand side pane. \nIn the Network pane: \nIn the Network Interface field, select the Wi-Fi value. \nIn the Service Set Identifier field, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nIn the Security Type field, select the WPA2 Enterprise option. \nActivate the Prevent MAC address randomization switch. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nIn the Protocols section, activate the EAP-TLS checkbox. \nIn the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP #1 option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates section, activate the Certificate #1 checkbox. \nOptional: Deactivate the Allow Trust Exceptions field to improve security. \nOptional: Click on the + icon in the bottom-right corner of the Network pane to add another network payload, and then configure the 802.1X Ethernet payload: \nNote: Depending on your hardware configurations, you can choose a different 802.1X Ethernet payload. The setup procedure is almost the same for all 802.1X payloads. You can repeat this step as many times as needed to cover all hardware configurations.\nIn the Network Interface field, select the value relevant to your hardware configuration, for example, First Active Ethernet. \nIn the Protocols section, activate the EAP-TLS checkbox. \nIn the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP #1 option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates section, activate the Certificate #1 checkbox. \nOptional: Deactivate the Allow Trust Exceptions field to improve security. \nIn the bottom-right corner of the Add a New Apple macOS Profile pane, click on the SAVE AND PUBLISH button. \nIn the View Device Assignment window, confirm if the profile will be pushed to correct devices, and then click on the PUBLISH button. \nResult: You created a profile for Portnox Cloud and macOS devices.\nAfter you created your profile, you can use your regular Workspace ONE UEM procedures to push it to managed computers immediately and see if it works correctly. For information on managing computers, pushing profiles, and troubleshooting, consult the Workspace ONE UEM documentation."

  "text": "Onboard Chromebooks with certificates using Google Workspace and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud certificates via Google Workspace SCEP to manage Chromebook (ChromeOS) devices.\nImportant:\nBefore you can deploy Portnox Cloud certificates via Google Workspace and SCEP, you must complete the following steps:\nIntegrate Portnox Cloud and Google Workspace\nPrepare a physical or virtual Windows server that can access Portnox Cloud SCEP services (has access to the Internet), where you will install the Google connector.\nMake sure that the Google administrator account that you will use for this configuration has the Shared Device Settings privileges.\nDownload and install the Google connector\nIn this section, you will download and install the Google Cloud Certificate Connector software on a Windows server. Google Workspace needs this connector to connect to the Portnox™ Cloud SCEP server.\nWhen a device managed by Google Workspace needs a certificate to connect to a managed network, the Google Cloud creates a SCEP request for that device. The Google Cloud Certificate Connector, running on a Windows server, polls the Google Cloud for any new requests every 30 seconds. If it finds a new request, the connector contacts the SCEP server, gets the certificate, sends it back to Google Cloud, and then Google Cloud propagates the certificate to the managed device.\nDo the following steps on the Windows server prepared earlier.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/scep. \nClick on the DOWNLOAD CONNECTOR link to download the Google connector. Then, follow the installation steps to complete installation. \nIn Step 2 of Google instructions, click on the DOWNLOAD button to download the connector configuration file (config.json). \nIn Step 3 of Google instructions, click on the GENERATE KEY button to generate and download the connector key (key.json). \nMove the downloaded files (config.json and key.json) to the installation folder as indicated by Google during the installation. \nOpen the Windows Services application, find the Google Cloud Certificate Connector service, right-click on it, and select the Start option from the context menu. \nIf the service doesn’t start, check if the user that you selected earlier has privileges to log on as a service ().\nGoogle connector logs are visible in the Event Viewer under .\nIf you need to change the connector configuration, for example, download a new key, place new files in the installation directory and restart the service.\nNote: If the Event Viewer shows warnings with the following description: Invalid JWT: Token must be a short-lived token (60 minutes) and in a reasonable time frame, check if your Windows server clock is synchronized with the universal clock.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the step in which you get the Cloud SCEP URL and password.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate from the Cloud portal and convert it to the Base-64 encoded X.509 format.\nYou need the root CA certificate so that your managed devices can verify the validity of Cloud RADIUS servers, which have certificates signed by this root CA certificate. If the root CA certificate is not distributed to managed devices, some devices may show a security warning each time that the user connects to networks managed by Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nIn Windows, double-click on the downloaded file. In the Open File - Security Warning window, click on the Open button. \nThe file will be opened in the Windows certificate manager.\nIn the Certificate window, click on the Details tab and then click on the Copy to File button. \nIn the Certificate Export Wizard, export the certificate in base-64 encoded format. \nIn the first step of the wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the second step of the wizard, select the Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) option. \nIn the third step of the wizard, select a file to save the exported tenant CA certificate, and click on the Next button. \nFor example, save the file as rootCertificate.cer, replacing the file downloaded earlier.\nIn the last step of the wizard, click on the Finish button. Then, close the Certificate window. \nDownload the tenant CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud tenant CA certificate from the Cloud portal and convert it to the Base-64 encoded X.509 format.\nYou need the tenant CA certificate from Portnox Cloud so that your managed devices can verify the validity of individual SCEP certificates, which are signed using the tenant CA certificate.\nNote: You must convert the downloaded certificate to the Base-64 encoded X.509 format because the certificate that you download is in the binary X.509 format, and Google Workspace only accepts Base-64 encoded certificates.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nIn the Trusted Root Certificates section, click on the Download PFX link, then save the downloaded file. \nThe default name of the file is Your_tenant_name - Portnox CLEAR.pfx, for example, Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR.pfx.\nCopy the value of the Issued to field in this section to a text file. You will need it when you create a Wi-Fi profile in Google Workspace. \nIn Windows, right-click on the downloaded file and select Open from the context menu. \nThe file will be opened in the Windows certificate manager.\nIn the certificate manager window, open the Certificates section in the left-hand pane and then double-click on Your_tenant_name - Portnox CLEAR in the right-hand side pane. \nIn the Certificate window, click on the Details tab and then click on the Copy to File button. \nIn the Certificate Export Wizard, export the certificate in base-64 encoded format. \nIn the first step of the wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the second step of the wizard, select the Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) option. \nIn the third step of the wizard, select a file to save the exported tenant CA certificate, and click on the Next button. \nFor example, save the file as tenantCertificate.cer.\nIn the last step of the wizard, click on the Finish button. Then, close the Certificate window. \nCreate a profile for the root CA certificate\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Google Workspace for the downloaded Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/certificates. \nIn the Organizational units section, select a specific organizational unit if you want this profile to apply only to the selected organizational unit. Otherwise, leave the default top organizational unit selected. \nClick on the ADD CERTIFICATE link. \nThe Add certificate pane opens.\nIn the Add certificate pane, enter the name for the profile and then click on the UPLOAD button. Then, select the root CA certificate downloaded and converted earlier. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud root CA, but you can use any name you like.\nYou will see basic information about the root CA certificate.\nIn the Certificate Authority section of the Add certificate pane, select Chromebook and optionally all other managed device platforms that you will use this certificate with, and then click on the Add button. \nResult: You created a profile for the Portnox Cloud root CA certificate.\nCreate a profile for the tenant CA certificate\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Google Workspace for the downloaded Portnox™ Cloud tenant CA certificate.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/certificates. \nIn the Organizational units section, select a specific organizational unit if you want this profile to apply only to the selected organizational unit. Otherwise, leave the default top organizational unit selected. \nClick on the ADD CERTIFICATE link. \nThe Add certificate pane opens.\nIn the Add certificate pane, enter the name for the profile and then click on the UPLOAD button. Then, select the tenant CA certificate downloaded and converted earlier. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud tenant CA, but you can use any name you like.\nYou will see basic information about the tenant CA certificate.\nIn the Certificate Authority section of the Add certificate pane, select Chromebook and optionally all other managed device platforms that you will use this certificate with, and then click on the Add button. \nResult: You created a profile for the Portnox Cloud tenant CA certificate.\nCreate a secure SCEP profile\nIn this section, you will create a secure SCEP profile in Google Workspace. The secure SCEP profile lets devices managed by Google Workspace contact the Portnox™ Cloud SCEP server via the connector.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/scep. \nIn the Organizational units section, select a specific organizational unit if you want this profile to apply only to the selected organizational unit. Otherwise, leave the default top organizational unit selected. \nClick on the ADD SECURE SCEP PROFILE link to create a secure SCEP profile. \nThe Add Secure SCEP pane opens.\nNote: Adjust the values proposed below to your requirements and your environment, if needed.\nIn the Device platforms section of the Add Secure SCEP pane, activate the Chromebook (user) checkbox. \nImportant: When managing Chromebooks using Google Workspace, you can only use user certificates for your Chromebooks with Portnox Cloud. This is because Google Workspace does not create device-based accounts in its authentication repository, so there is no way for Portnox Cloud to know your list of devices and to be able to authenticate based on any device identifiers. This also means you cannot use SCEP-based authentication in the managed guest mode, which is not associated with any Google user.\nIn the SCEP profile name section, enter the SCEP profile name for this secure SCEP profile. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP User, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Subject name format section, select the Fully Distinguished Name option. \nIn the Common name field, enter ${USER_EMAIL} as a variable to set subject common names for generated certificates. \nOptionally, in other fields, enter text information relevant to your organization. \nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the Custom option. Then, click on the + icon to add SANs and add a User Principal entry with the ${USER_EMAIL} variable string. \nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for the identity information in the SAN UPN field. You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nIn the Key usage section, select the Key encipherment option. \nIn the SCEP server attributes section: \nIn the SCEP server URL field, copy and paste the SCEP URL that you saved in the previous task in this series. \nIn the Extended key usage field, select the Client authentication option. \nIn the Challenge type field, select the Static option and then copy and paste the SCEP password that you saved in the previous task in this series. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the tenant CA certificate profile that you created in the earlier task. \nNote: Do not select the root CA certificate here. The root CA certificate is used in the Wi-Fi profile to confirm the identity of the Cloud RADIUS servers.\nIn the Network type this profile applies to field, activate the Wi-Fi checkbox. \nFor other fields, leave the default values or adjust values to your requirements and your environment, if needed. \nClick on the Save button to save your secure SCEP profile. \nResult: You created a trusted SCEP profile.\nNote: If you are trying to add a trusted SCEP profile but no profiles appear in the list, check if your Google Workspace has an active Chrome Enterprise Upgrade subscription. Trusted SCEP profiles are available only with the Chrome Enterprise Upgrade.\nCreate a Wi-Fi profile\nIn this section, you will create a Wi-Fi profile in Google Workspace for Chromebooks managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nOpen the Google Workspace admin console and access the pane by visiting the following URL: admin.google.com/ac/networks/wifi. \nIn the Organizational units section, select a specific organizational unit if you want this profile to apply only to the selected organizational unit. Otherwise, leave the default top organizational unit selected. \nClick on the ADD WI-FI link. \nThe Add Wi-Fi pane opens.\nIn the Platform access section of the Add Wi-Fi pane, activate the Enabled checkbox in the Chromebooks (by user) section. \nIn the Details section, enter a friendly name for the Wi-Fi profile in the Name field and enter the network SSID in the SSID field. \nNote: The value of the Name field is used only in Google Workspace for organizational purposes. Users see the network SSID in their Chromebooks network configuration.\nIn the Security settings section, in the Security Type field, select the WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (802.1X) option and in the Extensible Authentication Protocol field that appears, select the EAP-TLS option. \nIn the Server Certificate Authority field, select the root CA profile you created in the earlier task.. \nNote: This root certificate is used to validate the RADIUS server. Do not select the tenant CA certificate here. The tenant CA certificate is used in SCEP profiles to verify the validity of SCEP certificates.\nIn the Username field, enter the username for administering the network. \nYou can use any username you like. This field is required by Google Workspace but it is not used in practice.\nIn the SCEP profile field, select the trusted SCEP profile you created in the earlier task. \nIn the Issuer pattern section, in the Common name field, paste the issuer name that you copied from Portnox Cloud in the earlier task. \nFor other fields, leave the default values or adjust values to your requirements and your environment, if needed, then click on the SAVE button to save the Wi-Fi profile. \nResult: You created a Wi-Fi profile for the network managed by Portnox Cloud.\nTest your configuration on a managed Chromebook\nIn this section, you will test the configuration you created in Google Workspace by connecting a Chromebook to the network managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nTurn on your Chromebook and log in using your managed Google account. \nClick on the ⌔ icon in the notification area to open the Status Tray. \nClick on the ▼ icon next to the current network name in the Status Tray to show the list of available Wi-Fi networks. \nClick on the name of the network managed by Portnox Cloud to connect to it. \nThe symbol on the right side of the network SSID confirms that this network is managed by the organization.\nImportant: The first time you connect to the network may take a long time – approximately a minute. This is because Google Workspace needs to wait for the Google connector to poll the cloud and check for new SCEP requests, and the Google connector does that every 30 seconds. After the Google connector polls the cloud and finds the new request, it must connect to the Portnox Cloud SCEP server, receive a reply, and then send that reply to the Google cloud during the next poll in 30 seconds. Then, the Google Cloud must send the certificate to your Chromebook, and you can connect to the network."

  "text": "Deploy the local RADIUS server container in Microsoft Azure\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local RADIUS server container in Microsoft Azure using Azure Container Instances.\nTo deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container in Azure Container Instances, you must first configure the settings for the local RADIUS server container and generate environment variables. To do it, go to the following topic: Run the local RADIUS server in a container.\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nAzure Container Instances are not the only way to deploy the local RADIUS server container in Azure but it is the easiest way. Other options include Azure Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps, and more. If you choose a different option, please follow relevant Microsoft Azure documentation to deploy your container.\nIn order for the local RADIUS server container in Azure to be able to communicate with your NAS devices in your local network, you must create a virtual network in Azure and connect it to your local network. Azure offers many ways of achieving this. This topic is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find useful information in the following Microsoft documentation topics: Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the Azure Portal and Connect an on-premises network to Azure.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local RADIUS server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nIf you have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled in Azure for your policy, you must allow Portnox Cloud services to bypass MFA by whitelisting the services’ IP addresses. To lean how to do it, see the following topic: Bypass multi-factor authentication in Entra ID.\nWe highly recommend that you create a free Docker Hub account before you begin and use the credentials of that account to pull the Docker image. This is because Docker Hub has limits on the number of anonymous pulls per IP address per hour, and without credentials, you may be unable to pull the image due to those limits being exceeded by others sharing your infrastructure’s external IPs.\nWhen you’re using stateless containers and you want to update to a newer version of the Docker image, you need to delete the container and recreate it from scratch with the same parameters.\nCreate a virtual network and subnets\nIn this section, you will create a virtual network with a subnet for local RADIUS server containers.\nYou must deploy the local RADIUS server container to a subnet that is delegated to Container Instances. This subnet cannot contain other resource types. If you already have a subnet that meets this condition, you can skip this step and choose an existing subnet instead. You can also add a subnet to an existing virtual network instead.\nOpen your Azure Portal dashboard. \nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type virtual network and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Virtual network tile, click on the Create button and select the Virtual network option from the menu. \nIn the Basics step of the Create virtual network wizard, select the Subscription, Resource group, and Region, and enter a Virtual network name that you want to use for this virtual network. Then, click on the Next button twice to skip to the IP addresses step. \nIn this example, we used the network name Containers but you can use any name you like.\nIn the IP addresses step of the Create virtual network wizard, select the IPv4 address space by entering values in the top fields, and click on the 🗑 icon in the Subnets section to delete the proposed subnet. Then, click on the Review + create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nNote: When creating subnets together with the virtual network, you cannot choose the resource type for the subnet. That’s why you should delete the proposed subnet and create subnets later.\nIn this example, we entered the address space 10.1.0.0/16 but you can use any address space you like. The default address space proposed by Azure is 10.0.0.0/16, and that’s why the subnet to be deleted on the above screenshot is from this address space.\nWhen deployment is complete, click on the Go to resource button in the notification, or go to the created virtual network from your Azure home screen. \nIn the left-hand side menu of your virtual network pane, click on the Subnets option. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Subnet button to create a new subnet. \nIn the Add subnet pane, configure the IP address range as you prefer, enter a Name for the subnet, and in the SUBNET DELEGATION section, select the Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups option. \nIn this example, we used the subnet name Containers but you can use any name you like.\nCreate a container instance\nIn this section, you will deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container to the virtual network created in the previous step.\nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type container instances and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Container Instances tile, click on the Create button and select the Container Instances option from the menu. \nIn the Container Instances pane, in the Plan field, select the Container Instances option and click on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the Create container instance wizard, select the Subscription, Resource group, and Region, and enter a Container name that you want to use for this container. \nNote: Make sure that the selected Region is the same one as the one selected for the virtual network created earlier.\nIn this example, we used the container name radius but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Image source field, select the Other registry option, in the Image type field, select the Private option, in the Image field, enter: portnox/portnox-radius, in the Image registry login server field, enter index.docker.io, and in the Image registry user name and Image registry password fields, enter your Docker Hub credentials. Then, click on the Next : Networking > button below. \nNote: If you prefer not to use a Docker Hub account, in the Image type field, choose the Public option instead, and you will not have to enter any credentials. However, you may be unable to pull the image at this time due to Docker Hub hourly anonymous pull limits.\nIn the Networking tab, in the Networking type field, select the Private option, in the Virtual network field, select the virtual network you created earlier, and in the Subnet field, select the subnet dedicated to container instances that you created earlier. Then, click on the Next : Advanced > button. \nCopy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three Key and Value pairs. In the Mark as secure column, for RADIUS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID and RADIUS_GATEWAY_PROFILE select No and for RADIUS_GATEWAY_TOKEN select Yes. Then, click on the Review + create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nAfter the deployment is complete, note down the IP address address of the server. \nResult: Your local RADIUS server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nCreate a private hosted DNS zone\nIn this section, you will create a DNS zone for your virtual network, which lets you configure your NAS devices to access the local RADIUS server using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of its IP address.\nEvery time that you stop and restart your local RADIUS server container in Azure, it may be assigned a different IP address on the subnet, which means you would have to reconfigure your NAS devices after every restart. Unfortunately, at this time, Azure does not offer any method to maintain a fixed IP address on its virtual private cloud.\nTo overcome this problem, you can configure a DNS zone in Azure, assign a private FQDN to the local RADIUS server, and configure the NAS devices to access this server using this FQDN. This way, if you need to restart the container and get a different IP address, you can just change the IP address in the zone definition instead of having to reconfigure every NAS device.\nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type dns zone and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Private DNS zone tile, click on the Create button and select the Private DNS zone option from the menu. \nIn the Basics step of the Create Private DNS zone wizard, select the Subscription and Resource group, and enter a Name that you want to use for this private DNS zone. Then, click on the Review create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nIn this example, we used the DNS zone name vorlon.private but you can use any name you like.\nAfter deployment is complete, click on the Go to resource button. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Record set button to create a new record set. \nIn the Add record set pane, in the Name field, enter the name that you want to use for your local RADIUS server host, in the Type field, select the A – Address record option, in the IP address field, enter the IP address of your deployed local RADIUS server container that you noted down in the previous task, and then click on the OK button below. \nIn this example, we used the host name radius but you can use any name you like.\nNote: If you didn’t note down the IP address earlier, open a new browser tab and check the address by going to your container instance pane in Azure and noting down the value next to the IP address (Private) field.\nIn the left-hand side menu of your private DNS zone pane, click on the Virtual network links option. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Add button to add a new virtual network link. \nIn the Add virtual network link pane, in the Link name field, enter a name for this link, in the Subscription field, select the subscription, and in the Virtual network field, select your virtual network from the list. Then, click on the OK button below. \nIn this example, we used the name radius for the link but you can use any name you like.\nResult: You can configure your NAS devices in the virtual network to access the local RADIUS server using its FQDN (in our example, radius.vorlon.private) in the virtual network instead of its IP address (in our example, 10.1.0.4). You also need to configure the resolver in the NAS device to use azureprivatedns.net as one of the DNS servers.\nIf you need to restart the container and the IP address of the local RADIUS server changes, change the IP address in the record that you created for your hosted zone."

However, you may need to create a new SCEP request template, if you use device-based profiles, and if the device identification for this operating system uses different authentication repository properties than other operating systems.\nOpen your Workspace ONE UEM tenant dashboard in your browser, and log in as the administrator. \nIn the Certificate Authorities pane, click on the Add button. \nIn the Certificate Authority – Add/Edit pane: \nIn the Name field, enter a name for this configuration. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Authority Type field, select the Generic SCEP option. \nIn the SCEP URL field, paste the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Static Challenge and Confirm Challenge Phrase fields, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nClick on the TEST CONNECTION button to test your configuration. \nYou should get a message Test is successful. If you get a message Test is unsuccessful, check your configuration values and also check the status of your Airwatch Cloud Connector – either make sure it is disabled, or enabled and deployed.\nClick on the SAVE AND ADD TEMPLATE button to save this configuration and proceed to adding a SCEP request template. \nIn the Certificate Template – Add/Edit pane: \nIn the Name field, type a name for this template. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP Template, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP configuration you just created. \nIn the Subject Name field, enter the variables that Workspace ONE UEM will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn this example, we used the format CN={EmailAddress}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nIf you are using device-based certificates, use a device-related value such as CN={DeviceSerialNumber} instead. This will let Portnox Cloud create Cloud accounts for new devices, and the value of this variable will be used as the name for such accounts. In this case, new Portnox accounts for new devices will be named after the device’s serial number so you can identify the devices in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Private Key Length field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Private Key Type field, select both checkboxes. \nOptional: In the SAN Type field, click on the +Add button to add a new SAN entry. Then in the left-hand side field for the new SAN entry, select the User Principal Name option, and in the right-hand side field, type {EmailAddress}. \nNote: This step is necessary for user-based certificates. If you are using device-based certificates, you can skip this step because Portnox Cloud creates device-based Portnox accounts using the value in the Subject field, not the SAN field.\nThe variable in this field must match a value from the authentication repository in Portnox Cloud, which uniquely identifies the user or the device. This is the value on the basis of which the Portnox Cloud SCEP server will know for which user or device it should issue a certificate.\nIn this example, we used the variable {EmailAddress}, which generates the UPN SAN on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn the Automatic Certificate Renewal field, we recommend that you select the ENABLED option and in the Publish Private Key field, we recommend that you select the DISABLED option. \nThese values will not directly affect the integration. They apply to your certificate renewal management and security preferences. Adjust them to your needs, if necessary.\nClick on the SAVE button to save the template. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA and the SCEP request template.\nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Workspace ONE team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Workspace ONE to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Workspace ONE, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the Base-64 encoded X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nCreate a profile for Android\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Workspace ONE UEM for Android devices. This profile will contain the necessary certificates as well as SCEP and Wi-Fi configurations.\nIn the Profiles pane, click on the Add button and select the Add Profile option. \nIn the Add Profile pane, click on the Android icon. \nIn the Name Your Profile field, enter a name for the profile. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud Android Profile, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type credentials, and then click on the SEARCH button. Then, click on the ADD button in the Credentials row. \nIn the Credentials section: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Defined Certificate Authority option. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP CA configuration you created earlier. \nIn the Certificate Template field, select the name of the SCEP request template you created earlier. \nClick on the ADD button under the Credentials heading to add another credentials payload. \nIn the second Credentials section: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Upload option. \nIn the Certificate section, click on the CHOOSE FILE button and select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier. Then, click on the ATTACH CERTIFICATE button. \nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type wi-fi, and then click on the SEARCH button. Then, click on the ADD button in the Wi-Fi row. \nIn the Wi-Fi section: \nIn the Service Set Identifier field, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nActivate the Set as Active Network switch. \nIn the Security Type field, select the WPA/WPA2 Enterprise option. \nIn the SFA Type section, select the TLS option. \nIn the Identity Certificate field, select the Credentials 1 option. \nIn the Root Certificate section, activate the Credentials 2 checkbox. \nImportant: Newer Android versions may also require you to fill in the Identity and Domain fields, even if the values you input here are effectively ignored and the actual information is acquired from the certificate fields. The Identity field can contain any string, and the Domain field should specify the corporate domain supported by your authentication repository.\nCheck if your summary information is the same as on the screenshot, and then in the bottom-right corner of the profile pane, click on the NEXT button. \nIn the Assignment section, select the Smart Group as needed to push this profile to correct devices, configure any other options as needed in your environment, and then click on the SAVE & PUBLISH button. \nResult: You created a profile for Portnox Cloud and Android devices.\nAfter you created your profile, you can use your regular Workspace ONE UEM procedures to push it to managed devices immediately and see if it works correctly. For information on managing devices, pushing profiles, and troubleshooting, consult the Workspace ONE UEM documentation."

  "text": "Reactive measures: What to do if an outage happens\nWhen you configure authentication on NAS devices, you have an option to choose one of the following operational modes:\nauto: Devices that authenticate correctly using 802.1X are allowed access. Devices that fail 802.1X authentication are denied access.\nmac-based: Devices are allowed access or denied access depending on their MAC addresses.\nforce authorized: All devices are treated as authenticated (force the NAS to treat all devices as authorized).\nforce unauthorized: All devices are denied access (force the NAS to treat all devices as unauthorized).\nWhen you have an outage, you can access your NAS device and temporarily change this mode to force authorized. However, this will mean that every device that connects to the NAS will be given access. For security reasons, you may want to temporarily reconfigure your primary VLAN to not give access to any sensitive information.\nAfter the outage is over, you need to reconfigure your NAS devices back to their original settings.\nNote: This measure should be treated as a fallback measure in case everything else fails, because it requires the most work and it carries the most security risks.\nTo turn on the force authorized mode, consult your NAS device documentation. Check in your device documentation if you can do this for a template that is applied to many interfaces, which will make the process faster. We also strongly recommend to learn how to change the mode to force authorized before an outage happens."

While we aim to provide helpful examples for commonly used models, configurations may vary across manufacturers, models, and environments. As a result, we cannot guarantee that these steps will work in every scenario. For questions or issues related to RADIUS setup – which is an industry standard and not specific to Portnox – or device-specific settings and troubleshooting, we recommend consulting the device manufacturer’s documentation and contacting their support team. While Portnox Support is happy to assist where possible, please note that detailed configuration of third-party devices is typically best handled by the manufacturer.\nImportant: All values in this configuration are examples.

This guide includes only the installation and configuration of Docker and the Portnox Cloud local RADIUS server container.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local RADIUS server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nNote: This procedure has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.2 and RHEL 9.3. It applies either unmodified or with little modifications to all other popular Linux distributions.\nInstall Docker\nIn this section, you will learn how to install Docker on the Linux machine.\nSkip this section if Docker is already installed.\nImportant: If you don’t have a physical or virtual machine to install Docker, you can get a third-party Linux image. For example, you can download the latest Ubuntu Server image from the Linux VM Images project and import it into your hypervisor.\nOpen the Terminal window. \nInstall Docker using your distribution’s package management framework. \nUbuntu:\nsudo apt-get install docker.io -y\nImportant: While the Ubuntu apt repository includes Docker, for production machines Docker recommends using its own apt repository instead. This gives you access to newer versions and additional packages. You can find the relevant instructions in the official Docker documentation.\nRedHat:\nsudo yum install -y yum-utils sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo sudo yum install docker-ce sudo systemctl start docker\nTest Docker using the Hello World test container. \nsudo docker run hello-world\nResult: Hello from Docker!

  "text": "Deploy the local TACACS+ server container in Microsoft Azure\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local TACACS+ server container in Microsoft Azure using Azure Container Instances.\nTo deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container in Azure Container Instances, you must first configure the settings for the local TACACS+ server container and generate environment variables. To do it, go to the following topic: Run the local TACACS+ server in a container.\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nAzure Container Instances are not the only way to deploy the local TACACS+ server container in Azure but it is the easiest way. Other options include Azure Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps, and more. If you choose a different option, please follow relevant Microsoft Azure documentation to deploy your container.\nIn order for the local TACACS+ server container in Azure to be able to communicate with your NAS devices in your local network, you must create a virtual network in Azure and connect it to your local network. Azure offers many ways of achieving this. This topic is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find useful information in the following Microsoft documentation topics: Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the Azure Portal and Connect an on-premises network to Azure.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local TACACS+ server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nIf you have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled in Azure for your policy, you must allow Portnox Cloud services to bypass MFA by whitelisting the services’ IP addresses. To lean how to do it, see the following topic: Bypass multi-factor authentication in Entra ID.\nWe highly recommend that you create a free Docker Hub account before you begin and use the credentials of that account to pull the Docker image. This is because Docker Hub has limits on the number of anonymous pulls per IP address per hour, and without credentials, you may be unable to pull the image due to those limits being exceeded by others sharing your infrastructure’s external IPs.\nWhen you’re using stateless containers and you want to update to a newer version of the Docker image, you need to delete the container and recreate it from scratch with the same parameters.\nCreate a virtual network and subnets\nIn this section, you will create a virtual network with a subnet for local TACACS+ server containers.\nYou must deploy the local TACACS+ server container to a subnet that is delegated to Container Instances. This subnet cannot contain other resource types. If you already have a subnet that meets this condition, you can skip this step and choose an existing subnet instead. You can also add a subnet to an existing virtual network instead.\nOpen your Azure Portal dashboard. \nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type virtual network and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Virtual network tile, click on the Create button and select the Virtual network option from the menu. \nIn the Basics step of the Create virtual network wizard, select the Subscription, Resource group, and Region, and enter a Virtual network name that you want to use for this virtual network. Then, click on the Next button twice to skip to the IP addresses step. \nIn this example, we used the network name Containers but you can use any name you like.\nIn the IP addresses step of the Create virtual network wizard, select the IPv4 address space by entering values in the top fields, and click on the 🗑 icon in the Subnets section to delete the proposed subnet. Then, click on the Review + create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nNote: When creating subnets together with the virtual network, you cannot choose the resource type for the subnet. That’s why you should delete the proposed subnet and create subnets later.\nIn this example, we entered the address space 10.1.0.0/16 but you can use any address space you like. The default address space proposed by Azure is 10.0.0.0/16, and that’s why the subnet to be deleted on the above screenshot is from this address space.\nWhen deployment is complete, click on the Go to resource button in the notification, or go to the created virtual network from your Azure home screen. \nIn the left-hand side menu of your virtual network pane, click on the Subnets option. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Subnet button to create a new subnet. \nIn the Add subnet pane, configure the IP address range as you prefer, enter a Name for the subnet, and in the SUBNET DELEGATION section, select the Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups option. \nIn this example, we used the subnet name Containers but you can use any name you like.\nCreate a container instance\nIn this section, you will deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container to the virtual network created in the previous step.\nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type container instances and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Container Instances tile, click on the Create button and select the Container Instances option from the menu. \nIn the Container Instances pane, in the Plan field, select the Container Instances option and click on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the Create container instance wizard, select the Subscription, Resource group, and Region, and enter a Container name that you want to use for this container. \nNote: Make sure that the selected Region is the same one as the one selected for the virtual network created earlier.\nIn this example, we used the container name tacacs but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Image source field, select the Other registry option, in the Image type field, select the Private option, in the Image field, enter: portnox/portnox-tacacs, in the Image registry login server field, enter index.docker.io, and in the Image registry user name and Image registry password fields, enter your Docker Hub credentials. Then, click on the Next : Networking > button below. \nNote: If you prefer not to use a Docker Hub account, in the Image type field, choose the Public option instead, and you will not have to enter any credentials. However, you may be unable to pull the image at this time due to Docker Hub hourly anonymous pull limits.\nIn the Networking tab, in the Networking type field, select the Private option, in the Virtual network field, select the virtual network you created earlier, and in the Subnet field, select the subnet dedicated to container instances that you created earlier. Then, click on the Next : Advanced > button. \nCopy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three Key and Value pairs. In the Mark as secure column, for TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID and TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE select No and for TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN select Yes. Then, click on the Review + create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nAfter the deployment is complete, note down the IP address address of the server. \nResult: Your local TACACS+ server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nCreate a private hosted DNS zone\nIn this section, you will create a DNS zone for your virtual network, which lets you configure your NAS devices to access the local TACACS+ server using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of its IP address.\nEvery time that you stop and restart your local TACACS+ server container in Azure, it may be assigned a different IP address on the subnet, which means you would have to reconfigure your NAS devices after every restart. Unfortunately, at this time, Azure does not offer any method to maintain a fixed IP address on its virtual private cloud.\nTo overcome this problem, you can configure a DNS zone in Azure, assign a private FQDN to the local TACACS+ server, and configure the NAS devices to access this server using this FQDN. This way, if you need to restart the container and get a different IP address, you can just change the IP address in the zone definition instead of having to reconfigure every NAS device.\nIn the Azure Services menu, click on the Create a resource icon. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type dns zone and press the ↩ key. Then, on the bottom of the Private DNS zone tile, click on the Create button and select the Private DNS zone option from the menu. \nIn the Basics step of the Create Private DNS zone wizard, select the Subscription and Resource group, and enter a Name that you want to use for this private DNS zone. Then, click on the Review create button, and after the review is completed, click on the Create button. \nIn this example, we used the DNS zone name vorlon.private but you can use any name you like.\nAfter deployment is complete, click on the Go to resource button. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Record set button to create a new record set. \nIn the Add record set pane, in the Name field, enter the name that you want to use for your local TACACS+ server host, in the Type field, select the A – Address record option, in the IP address field, enter the IP address of your deployed local TACACS+ server container that you noted down in the previous task, and then click on the OK button below. \nIn this example, we used the host name tacacs but you can use any name you like.\nNote: If you didn’t note down the IP address earlier, open a new browser tab and check the address by going to your container instance pane in Azure and noting down the value next to the IP address (Private) field.\nIn the left-hand side menu of your private DNS zone pane, click on the Virtual network links option. \nIn the top menu, click on the + Add button to add a new virtual network link. \nIn the Add virtual network link pane, in the Link name field, enter a name for this link, in the Subscription field, select the subscription, and in the Virtual network field, select your virtual network from the list. Then, click on the OK button below. \nIn this example, we used the name tacacs for the link but you can use any name you like.\nResult: You can configure your NAS devices in the virtual network to access the local TACACS+ server using its FQDN (in our example, tacacs.vorlon.private) in the virtual network instead of its IP address (in our example, 10.1.0.4). You also need to configure the resolver in the NAS device to use azureprivatedns.net as one of the DNS servers.\nIf you need to restart the container and the IP address of the local TACACS+ server changes, change the IP address in the record that you created for your hosted zone."

  "text": "Onboard iOS devices with certificates using Workspace ONE UEM and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud certificates to iOS devices via Workspace ONE UEM and SCEP.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the later steps.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nYou need the root CA certificate so that your managed devices can verify the validity of Cloud RADIUS servers, which have certificates signed by this root CA certificate. If the root CA certificate is not distributed to managed devices, some devices may show a security warning each time that the user connects to networks managed by Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk to use it later. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nCreate the SCEP CA configuration and the SCEP request template\nIn this section, you will create the SCEP CA configuration and the SCEP request template in Workspace ONE UEM. This configuration and this template will be used by the profiles that you will create later.\nNote: If you already created Workspace ONE UEM profiles for other operating systems, you do not need to create a new SCEP CA configuration. However, you may need to create a new SCEP request template, if you use device-based profiles, and if the device identification for this operating system uses different authentication repository properties than other operating systems.\nOpen your Workspace ONE UEM tenant dashboard in your browser, and log in as the administrator. \nIn the Certificate Authorities pane, click on the Add button. \nIn the Certificate Authority – Add/Edit pane: \nIn the Name field, enter a name for this configuration. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Authority Type field, select the Generic SCEP option. \nIn the SCEP URL field, paste the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Static Challenge and Confirm Challenge Phrase fields, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nClick on the TEST CONNECTION button to test your configuration. \nYou should get a message Test is successful. If you get a message Test is unsuccessful, check your configuration values and also check the status of your Airwatch Cloud Connector – either make sure it is disabled, or enabled and deployed.\nClick on the SAVE AND ADD TEMPLATE button to save this configuration and proceed to adding a SCEP request template. \nIn the Certificate Template – Add/Edit pane: \nIn the Name field, type a name for this template. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP Template, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP configuration you just created. \nIn the Subject Name field, enter the variables that Workspace ONE UEM will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn this example, we used the format CN={EmailAddress}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nIf you are using device-based certificates, use a device-related value such as CN={DeviceSerialNumber} instead. This will let Portnox Cloud create Cloud accounts for new devices, and the value of this variable will be used as the name for such accounts. In this case, new Portnox accounts for new devices will be named after the device’s serial number so you can identify the devices in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Private Key Length field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Private Key Type field, select both checkboxes. \nOptional: In the SAN Type field, click on the +Add button to add a new SAN entry. Then in the left-hand side field for the new SAN entry, select the User Principal Name option, and in the right-hand side field, type {EmailAddress}. \nNote: This step is necessary for user-based certificates. If you are using device-based certificates, you can skip this step because Portnox Cloud creates device-based Portnox accounts using the value in the Subject field, not the SAN field.\nThe variable in this field must match a value from the authentication repository in Portnox Cloud, which uniquely identifies the user or the device. This is the value on the basis of which the Portnox Cloud SCEP server will know for which user or device it should issue a certificate.\nIn this example, we used the variable {EmailAddress}, which generates the UPN SAN on the basis of the user’s email address and is the recommended value for user-based SCEP certificates in Portnox Cloud.\nNote: Click on the + symbol to show a list of variables that you can use.\nIn the Automatic Certificate Renewal field, we recommend that you select the ENABLED option and in the Publish Private Key field, we recommend that you select the DISABLED option. \nThese values will not directly affect the integration. They apply to your certificate renewal management and security preferences. Adjust them to your needs, if necessary.\nClick on the SAVE button to save the template. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA and the SCEP request template.\nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Workspace ONE team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Workspace ONE to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Workspace ONE, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server.

For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nCreate a profile for iOS\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Workspace ONE UEM for iOS devices. This profile will contain the necessary certificates as well as SCEP and Wi-Fi configurations.\nIn the Profiles pane, click on the Add button and select the Add Profile option. \nIn the Add Profile pane, click on the Apple iOS icon. \nIn the Select Context pane, click on the Device icon. \nIn the Name Your Profile field, enter a name for the profile. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud iOS Profile, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type scep, and then click on the SEARCH button. Then, click on the ADD button in the SCEP row. \nIn the SCEP section: \nIn the Credential Source field, select the Defined Certificate Authority option. \nIn the Certificate Authority field, select the name of the SCEP CA configuration you created earlier. \nIn the Certificate Template field, select the name of the SCEP request template you created earlier. \nIn the Start typing to search for payloads and settings field, type credentials, and then click on the SEARCH button.

This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nIn the Protocols section, activate the EAP-TLS checkbox. \nIn the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates section, activate the Credentials checkbox. \nConfigure any other options as needed for your environment. \nCheck if your summary information is the same as on the screenshot, and then in the bottom-right corner of the profile pane, click on the NEXT button. \nIn the Assignment section, select the Smart Group as needed to push this profile to correct devices, configure any other options as needed in your environment, and then click on the SAVE & PUBLISH button. \nResult: You created a profile for Portnox Cloud and iOS devices.\nAfter you created your profile, you can use your regular Workspace ONE UEM procedures to push it to managed devices immediately and see if it works correctly. For information on managing devices, pushing profiles, and troubleshooting, consult the Workspace ONE UEM documentation."

This procedure assumes that the computer was onboarded using UEM/MDM software and already has access to the secure network.\nDownload the AgentP installation file from the download page. \ncurl -o agentp.msi \"https://clear.portnox.com/enduser/DownloadAgentPForOsAndPackageType?osType=2&packageType=Windows_x64\"\nReplace Windows_x64 with Windows_x86 if you have a 32-bit architecture.\nOptional: Configure the Windows registry REG_SZ (String) values for AgentP to hide the icon from the notification area (system tray). \nCreate a .reg file with the following content. \nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP] \"TrayIcon\"=\"hide\" \nImport the .reg file that you just created. \nregedit.exe /s your_reg_file.reg\nRun the installation from the command prompt with parameters for unattended installation. \nmsiexec /i agentp.msi /qn UI_LAUNCH=1\nOptional: Check the AgentP logs to confirm that AgentP is running in unattended mode. \nThe log file will contain an entry: Running in unattended mode.\nNote: If AgentP cannot recognize the user/device as onboarded, it will show the onboarding window after it’s installed, even if you follow all the steps above. To make sure that no onboarding window is shown, ensure that your endpoint management software first onboards the user/device, and only then run AgentP installation. If the user/device is onboarded (can connect to the company network), and the onboarding window still appears, examine the AgentP logs for an underlying cause.\nInstall AgentP on Windows in unattended enrollment mode or switch to unattended enrollment mode\nIn unattended enrollment mode, AgentP runs without user interaction. If you already installed Agent in interactive mode, you can also change its configuration so that it runs in unattended mode.\nPrepare a Windows registry file with REG_SZ (String) values that make AgentP run in unattended enrollment mode. \nCreate a .reg file with the following content. \nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP] \"Mode\"=\"umode\"\nImport the .reg file that you just created. \nregedit.exe /s your_reg_file.reg\nIf you had AgentP installed before importing the settings, restart the AgentP service. \nnet stop PortnoxAgentP\nnet start PortnoxAgentP\nImportant: If AgentP is already enrolled manually, before you switch to unattended mode, you must manually unenroll it by clicking on the Deactivate button in the AgentP user interface. Otherwise, AgentP will remain enrolled with the manually onboarded user and will not automatically switch to the current Active Directory or Entra ID user.\nInstall AgentP on Windows in kiosk mode or switch to kiosk mode\nKiosk mode means that AgentP is enrolled using the computer account, not the user account. If you already have AgentP installed in default (single-user) mode, you can change its configuration so that it runs in kiosk mode.\nImportant: This mode works only with authentication repositories that support computer accounts: Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory. This mode cannot be used with Okta Workforce Identity or Google Workspace.\nConfigure the Windows registry settings for AgentP to work in kiosk mode. \nCreate a .reg file with the following REG_SZ (String) values. \nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP] \"Mode\"=\"umode\" \"Etype\"=\"computer_account\"\nImport the .reg file that you just created. \nregedit.exe /s your_reg_file.reg\nIf you had AgentP installed before importing the settings, restart the AgentP service. \nnet stop PortnoxAgentP\nnet start PortnoxAgentP\nImportant: If AgentP is already enrolled manually, before you switch to kiosk mode, you must manually unenroll it by clicking on the Deactivate button in the AgentP user interface. Otherwise, AgentP will remain enrolled with the manually onboarded user and will not automatically switch to the computer account in Active Directory or Entra ID.\nInstall AgentP on Windows in unattended mode based on SCEP certificates\nIn this section, you will learn how to install AgentP in unattended mode if your Windows is not enrolled in Entra ID or Active Directory. However, this process requires UEM software.\nThe only way to achieve unattended AgentP user enrollment on a Windows computer not enrolled in Entra ID or Active Directory is by first installing a SCEP certificate on the computer. Then, install AgentP with a specific flag (registry key), which makes it enroll based on the data in the SCEP certificate. This allows you to install AgentP in unattended mode even with other authentication repositories like Okta and Google Workspace. However, the only way to get a SCEP certificate is by using UEM software.\nInstall SCEP certificates on clients. \nCreate a suitable configuration profile in your UEM software that makes the clients request SCEP certificates from the Portnox Cloud SCEP server.\nInstall registry key values for AgentP on clients. \nThe most common way that UEM software distributes registry key values is through PowerShell scripts (see: this external example). Consult your UEM documentation to learn how to distribute Windows registry key values.\nYou need to distribute the following REG_SZ (String) values of the [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP] key:\nstring value: EnrollmentIdentity\ndata: certificate\nstring value: EnrollmentCertificate\ndata: issuer:your_organization - Portnox CLEAR, which is the CN value in the Subject of your tenant CA certificate (Example: issuer:Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR).\nNote: To check the Subject of your tenant CA certificate, open the certificate on Windows, go to the Details tab, scroll down and click on the Subject entry, and note down the value after CN = in the text box below. \nAlternatively, you can find this value in Portnox Cloud: open the Settings menu, click on the option, and in the right-hand side pane, in the table in this section, note down the value next to the Issued to label.\nDistribute AgentP to clients. \nOnce the client Windows machines have the SCEP certificate installed and the required registry key values, you can now distribute AgentP. AgentP will detect the registry key values, use them to select the correct certificate installed on the computer, and then use this certificate for unattended enrollment.\nInstall AgentP on macOS in unattended mode based on SCEP certificates\nIn this section, you will learn how to install AgentP in unattended mode on macOS. However, this process requires UEM software.\nThe only way to achieve unattended AgentP user enrollment on macOS is by first installing a SCEP certificate on the computer. Then, install AgentP with a specific configuration file, which makes it enroll based on the data in the SCEP certificate. However, the only way to get a SCEP certificate is by using UEM software.\nImportant: The SCEP certificate must have the user’s UPN or email address in the Subject or in the SAN UPN field. There are no limitations for the support of authentication repositories, all repositories that are supported by Portnox Cloud are supported in this unattended mode.\nInstall SCEP certificates on clients. \nCreate a suitable configuration profile in your UEM software that makes the clients request SCEP certificates from the Portnox Cloud SCEP server.\nInstall a configuration script on clients. \nYou need to distribute the following configuration script, which creates the unattended.cfg and uipreferences.cfg files in the /var/agentp directory before the installation of AgentP:\nmkdir -p /var/agentp json='{\"HideUI\":true}' echo $json > /var/agentp/uipreferences.cfg json='{\"Mode\":\"certificate\",\"Certificate\":\"issuer:issued_to\",\"AutoSwitch\":true,\"UseCertificateSerialNumberAsDeviceId\":true,\"profileInstallationNeeded\":false}' echo $json > /var/agentp/unattended.cfg chmod a+rw /var/agentp chmod a+rw /var/agentp/uipreferences.cfg chmod a+rw /var/agentp/unattended.cfg\nImportant: If the SCEP certificate does not have the user’s email in the Subject or in the SAN UPN, add the Domain attribute by modifying the fifth line of the above code as follows: \njson='{\"Mode\":\"certificate\",\"Certificate\":\"issuer:issued_to\",\"AutoSwitch\":true,\"UseCertificateSerialNumberAsDeviceId\":true,\"Domain\":\"your_domain\",\"profileInstallationNeeded\":false}'\nAs issued_to, paste the CN value of your tenant CA certificate: your_organization - Portnox CLEAR. \nYou can get this value by opening the certificate and checking the Subject field, or in Portnox Cloud: open the Settings menu, click on the option, and in the right-hand side pane, in the table in this section, note down the value next to the Issued to label.\nFor example: \njson='{\"Mode\":\"certificate\",\"Certificate\":\"issuer:Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR\",\"AutoSwitch\":true,\"UseCertificateSerialNumberAsDeviceId\":true,\"Domain\":\"your_domain\",\"profileInstallationNeeded\":false}'\nAs your_domain, use the domain serviced by Portnox Cloud (the domain configured in your authentication repository integration). \nFor example: \njson='{\"Mode\":\"certificate\",\"Certificate\":\"issuer:Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR\",\"AutoSwitch\":true,\"UseCertificateSerialNumberAsDeviceId\":true,\"Domain\":\"vorlon.com\",\"profileInstallationNeeded\":false}'\nDistribute AgentP to clients. \nOnce the client machines have the SCEP certificate and the configuration file, you can now distribute AgentP. AgentP will parse the configuration file, use the values from that file to select the correct SCEP certificate installed on the computer, and then use this certificate for unattended enrollment.\nExamples:\nOnboard macOS devices with AgentP using Jamf and SCEP\nOnboard macOS devices with AgentP using Intune and SCEP\nOnboard macOS devices with AgentP using Kandji"

These users are always asked for their Google passwords.\nWhen creating a new user, we recommend that you assign that user to a temporary organizational unit or group with no IdP requirement, so that the user can activate their account and create a Google password. After the user activates their account, you can assign them to the third-party IdP login unit/group. Otherwise, this may cause problems with the first login."

Consult your device documentation for instructions on how to turn on packet capture.\nWe will keep expanding this section with more examples from popular equipment manufacturers.\nCisco example:\nip access-list extended RADIUS-FILTER permit ip host NAS_IP host RADIUS_IP permit ip host RADIUS_IP host NAS_IP monitor capture MYCAP1 buffer circular size 10 monitor capture MYCAP1 filter access-list RADIUS-FILTER monitor capture MYCAP1 interface interface_name both monitor capture MYCAP1 start monitor capture MYCAP1 stop\nWhere:\ninterface_name: name of the interface where your NAS device is connected to the uplink\nNAS_IP: the IP address of the NAS device in your local network\nRADIUS_IP: the IP address of your Portnox Cloud RADIUS server"

While we aim to provide helpful examples for commonly used models, configurations may vary across manufacturers, models, and environments. As a result, we cannot guarantee that these steps will work in every scenario. For questions or issues related to RADIUS setup – which is an industry standard and not specific to Portnox – or device-specific settings and troubleshooting, we recommend consulting the device manufacturer’s documentation and contacting their support team. While Portnox Support is happy to assist where possible, please note that detailed configuration of third-party devices is typically best handled by the manufacturer.\nWarning: This topic contains documentation prepared by our support agents more than 12 months ago. It may not cover the newest models or the newest interfaces of NAS devices. We’re working on bringing you updated documentation for NAS devices in the near future. However, the methods of setting up third-party devices may still change when the manufacturers update their firmware or release new models.\nAdd a custom RADIUS service: \nNavigate to: \nIn the new UDP service window, in Protocol type radius and select Radius. \nIn the Port field, add your Cloud RADIUS authentication port. \nCreate a RADIUS server object to match Cloud RADIUS details and configure the Protocol as MS-CHAP v2. \nOpen the Check Point Gateway object and verify that Mobile Access is enabled. \nUnder Mobile Access, enable Web - SSL VPN with web browsers. \nUnder Mobile Access Authentication, choose the RADIUS authentication method and point to the Cloud RADIUS object created earlier."

This guide includes only the installation and configuration of Docker Desktop and the Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ server container.\nWe recommend running Portnox Docker containers using Linux for performance reasons. Portnox Docker images are built for Linux so in Windows, they have to be run using virtualization. If you run Docker Windows in a virtual machine, you will need nested virtualization, which can affect performance.\nNote: This procedure has been tested on Windows 10 Enterprise running in a Hyper-V virtual machine. It applies either unmodified or with little modifications to all other Windows versions that are still supported by Microsoft and Docker, as long as they support Hyper-V or WSL, which is required by Docker Desktop.\nInstall Docker Desktop\nIn this section, you will learn how to follow Docker documentation to install Docker Desktop on the Windows machine.\nSkip this section if Docker Desktop is already installed.\nOptional: If you want to run Docker Desktop in a virtual machine, enable nested virtualization in your hypervisor on the host machine. \nThis step depends on the hypervisor that you are using. Below are some examples for popular hypervisors. Consult the documentation of your hypervisor for more information.\nHyper-V: Execute the following command in PowerShell with administrative privileges:\nSet-VMProcessor -VMName \"vm_name\" -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true\nwhere vm_name is the name of your virtual machine.\nVirtualBox: Go to and turn on the Enable Nested VT-x/AMD-V option.\nVMware Workstation: Go to and turn on the Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI option.\nEnable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and install Ubuntu: \nNote: You can run Docker Desktop with WSL or Hyper-V. WSL is recommended for performance reasons. If you need to run Docker Desktop with Hyper-V instead, refer to the official Docker and Microsoft documentation.\nOpen Windows PowerShell with administrative privileges. \nRun the following command to enable WSL and install Ubuntu: \nResult: WSL with Ubuntu is ready and you can proceed with Docker installation.\nInstall Docker Desktop: \nDownload the Docker Desktop installer from the official website. \nRun the downloaded installer file and in the installer window, when prompted, activate the Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V checkbox. \nRestart Windows when prompted. \nRun Docker Desktop from the Start menu or the desktop icon. \nOptional: Test Docker in the Windows command line: \nOpen the Windows command line (cmd). \nRun the following command: \nResult: If you see the following output, it means your installation was successful and Docker is ready:\nRun the Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ server container\nIn this section, you will learn how to deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container locally to the Windows machine.\nOpen a command prompt with administrative privileges and run the portnox/portnox-tacacs Docker container. \ndocker run -d -p 49:49/tcp ^ --name portnox-tacacs --restart=always ^ -v portnox-tacacs-data:/data ^ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE ^ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID ^ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN ^ portnox/portnox-tacacs:latest\nwhere copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE, copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID, and copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN are the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier. You can also copy them now directly from Portnox Cloud: .\nNote: The -v option creates and mounts a Docker volume that preserves the local TACACS+ server data in case the container stops running, for example, if the machine is restarted or crashes. Without this option, local TACACS+ cached data would be lost if the container stops running.

  "text": "Create or edit a risk assessment policy\nIn this topic, you will learn how to create and assign a risk assessment policy in Portnox™ Cloud.\nTo understand what are policies in Portnox Cloud, what types of policies are available, and how they work together with accounts and groups, read the following topic: What are policies in Portnox Cloud?.\nNote: The System Default Policy is tuned to meet the requirements of most configurations. When testing or initially deploying Portnox Cloud, you can skip this topic and keep the default settings. The System Default Policy is assigned to all groups, unless you create another policy and assign it manually.\nImportant: To be able to perform risk assessment, Portnox Cloud needs an agent on the device, which provides information about this device either directly to Portnox Cloud or to an integrated UEM solution. You can use Portnox AgentP for direct integration. You can also use Microsoft Intune or Jamf integration, so that Portnox Cloud can obtain information gathered by Intune/Jamf. For devices without such risk assessment information, the risk score is automatically set to 0.\nRisk assessment policies are based on a set of attributes. You assign a value to each attribute. To learn how the final score is calculated on the basis of attributes, read the following FAQ entry: How is the risk score calculated for risk assessment policies?.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Policies option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand menu, click on the RISK ASSESSMENT POLICIES tile. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the Create new button to create a new policy. \nNote: You can also click on the ✎ icon on the right-hand side of the selected line that represents the policy to edit an existing policy, or click on the ⧉ icon to create a duplicate of one of the existing policies and edit it. The creation and editing processes are almost the same.\nIn the Risk Assessment Policy name field, enter the name for the new policy and in the Description (optional) field, enter an optional description. \nIf you’re editing the System Default Policy, you cannot change its name.\nOn the right-hand side, adjust the slider, if needed. \nThis slider controls the behavior if the device does not meet the policy. By default, if the risk score is between 0 and 69, Portnox Cloud will allow network access, and if the risk score is higher, it will generate an alert, but it will not block network access for the device. By adjusting the two handles on the slider, you can change this behavior, and, for example, configure Portnox Cloud to block the device if the risk score is above 70 and generate an alert if the risk score is over 50.\nIn the Agent-based (AgentP) section on the left-hand side, select the operating system to configure the attributes for this operating system. \nEach policy contains rules for all operating systems. If you do not configure a specific operating system, Portnox Cloud will use default settings for that operating system.\nFor detailed description of all available attributes, see the section Risk assessment policy attributes below.\nImportant: If you integrated Portnox Cloud with Microsoft Intune, there is also an Agentless (requires Intune) section on the left-hand side. This section contains attributes for all operating systems, which apply a Cloud risk score depending on the status of Intune integration and compliance. To learn more about these attributes, see the following topic: Configure risk based on the Intune integration. \nIn the right-hand side pane, configure the attributes for the selected operating system. \nRepeat the above steps for other operating systems. \nTo save your policy settings, click on the Save policy button on the bottom right of the page. \nResult: You created or edited a risk assessment policy. You can now assign this policy to groups.\nTo assign policies to groups, see the following topic: Assign policies to a group.\nRisk assessment policy attributes\nIn this section, you will learn to configure all risk assessment policy attributes for different operating systems.\nNote: Attributes are listed alphabetically. Some attributes are available for multiple operating systems. Some attributes are available only with a specific integration: Intune, Jamf, or Absolute.\nNote: In the Agentless section, there are two tabs: INTUNE and JAMF. For Windows and Android devices, only the INTUNE tab is active. For macOS and iOS devices, both tabs are active, and you should select attributes depending on whether the devices are managed by Intune or by Jamf. If they are managed by both, Intune has priority.\nAdministrator privileges\nPortnox Cloud increases the risk score if the user of the device is logged in with administrator privileges.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS\nParameters:\nRisk score\nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that the current user has logged in to the device with administrator privileges, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nAntivirus\nPortnox Cloud increases the risk score if the device does not have Portnox Cloud-supported antivirus software installed and active.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux\nParameters:\nRisk score \nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that the device has no Portnox Cloud-supported antivirus software that is active, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nGrace period \nEnter or select a value from 0 to 14400 minutes (0 = no grace period, 14400 = 10 days). If the policy attribute condition is true and the risk score is high enough to block the device, the block is delayed by the selected time. This lets the user fix the issue without losing access to the network.\nNote: If multiple policy attributes have grace periods and their conditions are true (i.e., risk is detected) with risk scores high enough to block the device, Portnox Cloud applies only the shortest of those grace periods. A grace period set for an attribute that would not cause a block does not apply, even if it is shorter than others.\nApplications\nYou can specify applications that are forbidden and applications that are required on the device. Portnox Cloud increases the risk score if if even one forbidden application is found or if even one required application is not found.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS\nParameters:\nRisk score: \nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that at least one of the forbidden applications is on the device, or that at least one of the required applications is missing, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nGrace period \nEnter or select a value from 0 to 14400 minutes (0 = no grace period, 14400 = 10 days). If the policy attribute condition is true and the risk score is high enough to block the device, the block is delayed by the selected time. This lets the user fix the issue without losing access to the network.\nNote: If multiple policy attributes have grace periods and their conditions are true (i.e., risk is detected) with risk scores high enough to block the device, Portnox Cloud applies only the shortest of those grace periods. A grace period set for an attribute that would not cause a block does not apply, even if it is shorter than others.\nFORBIDDEN APPLICATIONS \nClick on the Add an application link to add a name of an application to the forbidden list. Repeat for other applications if necessary.\nREQUIRED APPLICATIONS: \nClick on the Add an application link to add a name of an application to the required list. Repeat for other applications if necessary.\nCertificates\nYou can specify certificates that are required to be installed on the device. Portnox Cloud increases the risk score if even one required certificate is not found on the device. You can identify certificates by thumbprint or by issuer. If you enter an issuer, any certificate from that issuer will be considered valid.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS\nParameters:\nRisk score \nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu. If Portnox Cloud detects that one of the specified certificates is missing, and if the risk score is below this value, Portnox Cloud will increase the risk score to this value.\nAdd certificate thumbprint \nClick on this link to enter a thumbprint of the required certificate. Repeat if necessary for other thumbprints.\nAdd certificate issuer \nClick on this link to enter an issuer of the required certificate. Repeat if necessary for other issuers.\nThe certificate issuer must be listed in the X.500 Directory Specification format. In Windows, you can find this information by opening a command window, typing certlm.msc to run the certificate manager, selecting a certificate, double-clicking on it, selecting the Details tab, and selecting Issuer from the list.\nFor example: CN = DigiCert Trusted Root G4, OU = www.digicert.com, O = DigiCert Inc, C = US\nNote: You can specify a list of thumbprints and a list of issuers. If Portnox Cloud finds even one certificate from the thumbprint list missing, or if it finds even one certificate from the issuer list missing, it will increase the risk score. First, Cloud checks for all thumbprints. If it finds that one or more thumbprints are missing, it searches remaining device certificates for certificates that were issued by any of the listed issuers. If it doesn’t find a matching certificate for one or more issuers, it increases the risk score.\nCrowdStrike Dormant\nYou can increase the risk score if CrowdStrike Falcon is dormant for the device.\nOperating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux\nParameters:\nRisk score\nEnter a number from 0 to 100 or select a number from the drop-down menu.

  "text": "Deploy the local RADIUS server container using Docker Desktop on Windows\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local RADIUS server container using Docker Desktop on a local Windows machine (physical or virtual).\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nWe assume that the Windows machine is already installed, configured, updated, and connected to the local network. This guide includes only the installation and configuration of Docker Desktop and the Portnox Cloud local RADIUS server container.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local RADIUS server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nWe recommend running Portnox Docker containers using Linux for performance reasons. Portnox Docker images are built for Linux so in Windows, they have to be run using virtualization. If you run Docker Windows in a virtual machine, you will need nested virtualization, which can affect performance.\nNote: This procedure has been tested on Windows 10 Enterprise running in a Hyper-V virtual machine. It applies either unmodified or with little modifications to all other Windows versions that are still supported by Microsoft and Docker, as long as they support Hyper-V or WSL, which is required by Docker Desktop.\nInstall Docker Desktop\nIn this section, you will learn how to follow Docker documentation to install Docker Desktop on the Windows machine.\nSkip this section if Docker Desktop is already installed.\nOptional: If you want to run Docker Desktop in a virtual machine, enable nested virtualization in your hypervisor on the host machine. \nThis step depends on the hypervisor that you are using. Below are some examples for popular hypervisors. Consult the documentation of your hypervisor for more information.\nHyper-V: Execute the following command in PowerShell with administrative privileges:\nSet-VMProcessor -VMName \"vm_name\" -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true\nwhere vm_name is the name of your virtual machine.\nVirtualBox: Go to and turn on the Enable Nested VT-x/AMD-V option.\nVMware Workstation: Go to and turn on the Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI option.\nEnable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and install Ubuntu: \nNote: You can run Docker Desktop with WSL or Hyper-V. WSL is recommended for performance reasons. If you need to run Docker Desktop with Hyper-V instead, refer to the official Docker and Microsoft documentation.\nOpen Windows PowerShell with administrative privileges. \nRun the following command to enable WSL and install Ubuntu: \nResult: WSL with Ubuntu is ready and you can proceed with Docker installation.\nInstall Docker Desktop: \nDownload the Docker Desktop installer from the official website. \nRun the downloaded installer file and in the installer window, when prompted, activate the Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V checkbox. \nRestart Windows when prompted. \nRun Docker Desktop from the Start menu or the desktop icon. \nOptional: Test Docker in the Windows command line: \nOpen the Windows command line (cmd). \nRun the following command: \nResult: If you see the following output, it means your installation was successful and Docker is ready:\nRun the Portnox Cloud local RADIUS container\nIn this section, you will deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container locally to the Windows machine.\nOpen a command prompt with administrative privileges and run the portnox/portnox-radius Docker container. \ndocker run -d -p 1812:1812/udp -p 1813:1813/udp ^ --name portnox-radius --restart=always ^ -v portnox-radius-data:/data ^ -e RADIUS_GATEWAY_PROFILE=copied_RADIUS_GATEWAY_PROFILE ^ -e RADIUS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID=copied_RADIUS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID ^ -e RADIUS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=copied_RADIUS_GATEWAY_TOKEN ^ portnox/portnox-radius:latest\nwhere copied_RADIUS_GATEWAY_PROFILE, copied_RADIUS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID, and copied_RADIUS_GATEWAY_TOKEN are the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier. You can also copy them now directly from Portnox Cloud: .\nNote: The -v option creates and mounts a Docker volume that preserves the local RADIUS server data in case the container stops running, for example, if the machine is restarted or crashes. Without this option, local RADIUS cached data would be lost if the container stops running. To learn more about Docker volumes and an alternative, bind mounts, see Docker documentation.\nOptional: View the logs for the portnox/portnox-radius Docker container. \ndocker logs portnox-radius -f\nOptional: Check if your NAS is configured correctly and if the RADIUS packets are reaching your Docker container. \ndocker exec -it portnox-radius sh / #apk add tcpdump / #tcpdump -i eth0 -v port 1812\nResult: Your local RADIUS server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nAutomatically update the existing local container\nIn this section, you will learn how to automatically update your Docker container to the latest version by deploying another Docker container: portnox-autoupdate.\nImportant: The portnox-autoupdate Docker container automatically updates all Portnox Docker containers to their latest versions as soon as they are available. If you already installed the portnox-autoupdate Docker container to automatically update another Portnox Docker container, you do not need to install it again.\nFind the organization ID: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to . \nIn the Self Onboarding section, see the URL that is displayed. \nNote: If self-onboarding is not activated, click on the Edit link and temporarily turn it on to see the URL.\nThe organization ID is the last part of the URL, after the last / symbol.\nFor example, if the URL is https://user-registration.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76, then the organization ID is b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nGet an API token from Portnox Cloud: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to \nClick on the Generate token link. \nIn the GENERATE A NEW TOKEN window, enter the name for the token that describes its purpose and click on the Generate token button. \nClick on the ⧉ button to copy the code and store it in a safe place. \nImportant: You will not be able to access this code again after closing this window.\nDeploy the portnox-autoupdate Docker container: \ndocker run --restart=always -d --name portnox-autoupdate ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^ -v portnox-autoupdate-logs:/app/logs ^ -e AUTO_UPDATE_ORG_ID=your_organization_ID ^ -e AUTO_UPDATE_PORTNOX_API_TOKEN=your_API_access_token ^ portnox/portnox-autoupdate:latest\nFor example:\ndocker run --restart=always -d --name portnox-autoupdate ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^ -v portnox-autoupdate-logs:/app/logs ^ -e AUTO_UPDATE_ORG_ID=b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76 ^ -e AUTO_UPDATE_PORTNOX_API_TOKEN=zZD0XR18UmNc8gG1TRt9ZyMhHnl ^ portnox/portnox-autoupdate:latest"

  "text": "Guest access – Fortinet\nIn this topic, you will learn how to configure Fortinet controllers to work together with the Portnox™ Cloud captive portal for guest user authentication.\nBefore you begin configuring your controller, you must do the following in Portnox Cloud: \nOpen the Cloud RADIUS configuration, select your primary RADIUS instance, and copy the following values: Cloud RADIUS IP, Authentication port, and Shared Secret.\nConfigure the guest network in Portnox Cloud and note down the values of the fields: Captive Portal URL and IP (for walled garden).\nSave these values in a temporary text file or keep your Portnox Cloud configuration open in another browser tab for easy copying and pasting.\nAlso, in the Fortinet web interface, make sure that your access points are authorized ().\nImportant: Before starting, make sure that your Fortinet devices have the latest firmware. Older firmware versions do not support some functions, such as HTTPS redirection using a custom certificate in bridge mode.\nImportant: This guide provides general instructions for integrating Portnox Cloud with specific third-party devices. While we aim to provide helpful examples for commonly used models, configurations may vary across manufacturers, models, and environments. As a result, we cannot guarantee that these steps will work in every scenario. For questions or issues related to RADIUS setup – which is an industry standard and not specific to Portnox – or device-specific settings and troubleshooting, we recommend consulting the device manufacturer’s documentation and contacting their support team. While Portnox Support is happy to assist where possible, please note that detailed configuration of third-party devices is typically best handled by the manufacturer.\nYou can create a captive portal configuration on Fortinet controllers in one of two modes: the local bridge mode or the tunnel mode. To create a captive portal configuration:\nFirst, follow the steps to create the RADIUS server (common for both modes)\nThen, optionally configure the TLS certificate (also common for both modes)\nFinally, select the mode that fits your network configuration.\nIn the local bridge mode, the controller is only responsible for configuration management. This mode is often used in teleworking, for example, if an employee uses a company access point at home. In the tunnel mode, all the traffic from the access point is tunnelled back to the controller.\nNote: This setup was tested on a FortiGate 40F firewall and a FortiAP 233G access point.\nCreate the RADIUS server configuration\nIn this section, you will enter Portnox Cloud RADIUS server information in the Fortinet web interface and CLI.\nIn the Fortinet web interface, in the left-hand side menu, click on the option to open the list of RADIUS servers. \nAbove the SSID list, click on the Create New button. \nIn the New RADIUS Server pane, enter a Name for the RADIUS server. In the Authentication method field, select the Specify option, and then select the PAP option. \nIn the Primary Server section, paste the Cloud RADIUS IP value copied from Portnox Cloud into the IP/Name field, and paste the Shared Secret value copied from Portnox Cloud into the Secret field. Then, click on the OK button to save the configuration. \nClick on the Edit in CLI button on the right-hand side of the pane to open the CLI Console window. Then, execute the following commands: \nset radius-port Authentication port end\nwhere Authentication port is the value copied from Portnox Cloud. Then, close the CLI Console window.\nImportant: The Fortinet web interface has a major limitation. It assumes that the default port numbers for RADIUS servers are 1812 (authentication) and 1813 (accounting), and it does not let you select a custom number in the web interface. In the CLI interface, you cannot change the accounting port, and you cannot have different ports for the primary and the secondary RADIUS server. That’s why you can only use one Portnox Cloud RADIUS server in this configuration, even if you have two instances configured in Portnox Cloud.\nOptional: To test if your configuration change was successful, you can click on the RADIUS server name and then click on the Edit button to edit it, and then click on the Test Connectivity button in the Edit RADIUS Server pane. \nConfigure the TLS certificate\nOptional: In this section, you will upload and configure your own TLS certificate so you can use the captive portal in HTTPS mode.\nIf you do not complete these steps, most devices will display a warning that the captive portal is not working in a secure mode. If you want to avoid such warnings, and run the captive portal in secure mode (HTTPS):\nObtain a domain or subdomain for your captive portal\nConfigure that domain or subdomain in your DNS server\nObtain a TLS certificate for that domain or subdomain.\nTo follow the steps below, you will need:\nThe domain or subdomain name\nThe TLS certificate file for your domain or subdomain name together with the private key file (as a single PKCS#12 file or as two Base-64 encoded X.509 files)\nThe CA certificate file for the issuer of your TLS certificate in the Base-64 encoded X.509 format.\nImport the certificates: \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the option to open the list of certificates. \nNote: If the option Certificates is not visible, go to Feature Visibility and activate .\nAbove the certificate list, click on the Create/Import button, and then select the CA Certificate option. \nIn the Import CA Certificate pane, in the Type field, click on the File option, and then click on the Upload button. Then, select the CA certificate file for the issuer of your TLS certificate and click on the OK button. \nResult: Your issuer’s certificate will be listed in the Remote CA Certificate section as CA_Cert_1 or higher number if you already have custom CA certificates imported.\nAbove the certificate list, click on the Create/Import button, and then select the Certificate option. \nIn the Create Certificate pane, click on the Import Certificate button. \nIn the Import Certificate section, in the Type field, select either the PKCS#12 option (if your certificate and private key are in a single file) or the Certificate option (if your certificate and private key are in separate files). Then, use the relevant button to upload the file or files, enter your private key password in the Password and Confirm password fields, and in the Certificate name field, type the name for your certificate as it will appear on the list. \nResult: Your domain or subdomain certificate will be listed in the Local Certificate section together with the domain or subdomain that it was issued for.\nConfigure authentication settings: \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the option to open the Authentication Settings pane. \nIn the Authentication Settings pane, in the Captive portal type field, select the FQDN option, activate the Captive portal switch, and in the list, click on the Create button to create a new address entry. \nIn the New Address pane, in the Name and FQDN fields, enter the domain or subdomain name for your captive portal, and in the Type field, select the FQDN option. Then, click on the OK button to return to the Authentication Settings pane. \nIn the Authentication Settings pane, activate the HTTP and HTTPS checkboxes, activate the HTTP redirect switch, activate the Certificate switch, and in the Certificate field, select the TLS certificate for your domain or subdomain. Then, click on the OK button to save your configuration. \nClick on the Edit in CLI button on the right-hand side of the pane to open the CLI Console window. Then, execute the following commands: \nset auth-type http https set auth-cert \"Guest portal domain\" set auth-secure-http enable end\nwhere Guest portal domain is the domain of the certificate that you imported earlier (in our example, guests.vorlon.com). Then, close the CLI Console window.\nSet up the local bridge mode\nIn this section, you will set up a Portnox captive portal in a Fortinet controller using the local bridge mode.\nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the option to open the list of SSIDs. \nAbove the SSID list, click on the Create New button, and then select the SSID option. \nIn the Create New SSID pane, enter the name for the configuration in the Name field, and in the Traffic mode field, select the Bridge option. \nIn the WiFi Settings section, in the SSID field, enter the SSID. \nIn the Security Mode Settings section, in the Security mode field, select the Open option.

This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nIn the Encryption Type field, select the WPA option. \nIn the Accepted EAP types field, select only the TLS option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates field, select the root certificate from the list. \nNote: This is the same certificate that you added earlier in the Certificates pane.\nIn the Trusted Certificate Name field, type: clear-rad.portnox.com. \nActivate the Certificate Required checkbox. \nIn the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP CA configuration that you added earlier in the Cloud Extender. \nClick on the Next button twice, and then on the Publish button to publish this policy. Then, follow the steps as requested, including confirming and entering your MaaS 360 password. \nResult: You created a profile for Portnox Cloud and iOS devices. You can now assign this profile to devices by following MaaS 360 documentation."

  "text": "Ethernet 802.1X configuration – Cisco (most models)\nThis is a general configuration template for Cisco switches with the IOS or NX-OS operating system.\nWarning: We tested this configuration on several models and several versions of Cisco operating systems (IOS and NX-OS) but we cannot guarantee that it will cover every Cisco model. Also, the configuration is general and may not fit every single environment. Therefore, to get the most accurate and current configuration guidance on switch 802.1X configuration, we strongly recommend that you refer to the documentation provided by Cisco on these topics for your particular device model and OS version.\nImportant: All values in this configuration are examples. Make sure to adjust the configuration to your individual RADIUS server addresses, ports, and keys, as well as device interfaces by replacing the values presented as underlined italics.\nEnable AAA services on the device. \nCreate a new RADIUS server group. \naaa group server radius PORTNOX\nIn this configuration, we assume that you are using both Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers.\nAdd a group member to represent the US RADIUS server. \nserver name PORTNOX-CLOUD-US\nAdd a group member to represent the Europe RADIUS server. \nserver name PORTNOX-CLOUD-EMEA\nExit group member configuration. \nConfigure the switch to use the RADIUS server group for authentication. \naaa authentication dot1x default group PORTNOX\nConfigure the switch to use the RADIUS server group for authorization. \naaa authorization network default group PORTNOX\nSend new accounting information to the RADIUS server group. \naaa accounting update newinfo\nSend all session start and stop events to the RADIUS server group. \nWarning: If your switch responds with the following warning, type No and proceed to the next step: \nThis operation will permanently convert all relevant authentication commands to their CPL control-policy equivalents. As this conversion is irreversible and will disable the conversion CLI 'authentication display [legacy|new-style]', you are strongly advised to back up your current configuration before proceeding. Do you wish to continue?.\nDo not answer Yes, or you may irreversibly change your configuration; to fix it, you will have to reset your switch to factory settings.\naaa accounting identity default start-stop group PORTNOX\nSend all session stop events to the RADIUS server group even if there is no start event. \naaa accounting send stop-record always\nEnable 802.1X port-based authentication on the device. \ndot1x system-auth-control\nOptional: Enable critical EAP over LAN (EAPOL) frames, allowing them to be processed with higher priority in the authentication process. \nOptional: Specify the time interval during which critical EAP over LAN (EAPOL) frames must be received for successful recovery in case of interruption. \ndot1x critical recovery delay 2000\nOptional: Specify that the switch considers the RADIUS server as dead if no response is received within 30 seconds for four consecutive attempts. \nradius-server dead-criteria time 30 tries 4\nOptional: Set the amount of time (in minutes) during which a RADIUS server is considered unreachable or dead after a specified number of consecutive failed attempts. \nAdd your individual Portnox Cloud RADIUS server IPs and ports to the switch configuration: \nImportant: The IP addresses, port numbers, and keys below are examples. Replace them with your individual IP addresses, port numbers, and keys from your Portnox Cloud configuration.\nAdd the US Cloud RADIUS server: \nradius server PORTNOX-CLOUD-US\naddress ipv4 20.119.69.248 auth-port 10322 acct-port 10323\nkey rTHO9HEo9BcqfC9Yg0hHFelK6o0tH8N1\nexit\nAdd the Europe Cloud RADIUS server: \nradius server PORTNOX-CLOUD-EMEA\naddress ipv4 52.232.122.157 auth-port 10476 acct-port 10477\nkey fnSrSEHhXFZ5Rqpz756NJhkeVqIHTlPt\nexit\nConfigure 802.1X authentication on interface 0/1: \ninterface gigabitethernet 0/1\nNote: This is an example interface. Adjust the interface in the configuration to your specific interface.\nEnable auto port control for authentication, allowing the switch port to dynamically determine whether to permit or restrict traffic based on the authentication status of the connected device. \nauthentication port-control auto\nNote: On some switch models, notably Cisco 9300, you may have to first run the following command: \nswitchport mode access\nConfigure the 802.1X Port Access Entity (PAE) on a switch port to operate in authenticator mode, enabling the port to control access based on the authentication status of connected devices. \nEnable the single-host mode for authentication, allowing only one MAC address per port to be authenticated, preventing multiple devices from connecting through a single port. \nauthentication host-mode single-host\nOptional: Enable MAC address bypass authentication on the interface. \nConfigure the order in which authentication methods are attempted on a port, specifying that the switch should first attempt 802.1X authentication and then fall back to MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) if 802.1X authentication is not successful. \nauthentication order dot1x mab\nConfigure a critical auth VLAN \nNote: If, for any reason, your NAS device is temporarily unable to connect to Portnox Cloud RADIUS servers, the client device attempting 802.1X authentication is assigned to this VLAN. This lets your network administrators maintain client connectivity to certain resources without compromising security in circumstances such as an Internet connection failure.\nNote: This function may be unsupported on some switches. Consult Cisco documentation for more information about its availability for your specific model and software version.\nDefine the VLAN that will be used for critical authentication: \nIn this example, we are using VLAN 10, but you can use a different configuration.\nAssign an IP Address to the VLAN: \ninterface vlan 10 ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0\nIn this example, we are using the network 10.0.10.0/24 but you can use a different configuration.\nConfigure the g0/1 interface to use the critical auth VLAN: \ninterface gigabitethernet g0/1\nauthentication event server dead action authorize vlan 10\nIf you’re using a different VLAN, change the vlan 10 parameter.\nVerify the 802.1X configuration. \nshow dot1x all\nExpected output:\nSysauthcontrol Enabled\nDot1x Protocol Version 2\nDot1x Info for GigabitEthernet0/1\nPAE = AUTHENTICATOR\nPortControl = AUTO\nControlDirection = Both\nHostMode = SINGLE_HOST\nQuietPeriod = 60\nServerTimeout = 30\nSuppTimeout = 30\nReAuthMax = 2\nMaxReq = 2\nTxPeriod = 30\nCritical Auth VLAN = 10\nServer Dead Action = Authorize VLAN 10\nOptional: Debug the 802.1X configuration, if necessary. \ndebug mab all\ndebug dot1x all\ndebug radius\ndebug aaa authentication\ndebug aaa authorization\nHere is the entire example configuration for your convenience:\naaa new-model ! aaa group server radius PORTNOX server name PORTNOX-CLOUD-US server name PORTNOX-CLOUD-EMEA exit ! aaa authentication dot1x default group PORTNOX aaa authorization network default group PORTNOX aaa accounting update newinfo aaa accounting identity default start-stop group PORTNOX aaa accounting send stop-record always ! dot1x system-auth-control ! dot1x critical eapol dot1x critical recovery delay 2000 ! radius-server dead-criteria time 30 tries 4 radius-server deadtime 30 ! radius server PORTNOX-CLOUD-US address ipv4 20.119.69.248 auth-port 10322 acct-port 10323 key rTHO9HEo9BcqfC9Yg0hHFelK6o0tH8N1 exit ! radius server PORTNOX-CLOUD-EMEA address ipv4 52.232.122.157 auth-port 10476 acct-port 10477 key fnSrSEHhXFZ5Rqpz756NJhkeVqIHTlPt exit ! interface gigabitethernet 0/1 authentication port-control auto dot1x pae authenticator authentication host-mode single-host mab authentication order dot1x mab ! vlan 10 interface vlan 10 ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0 ! interface gigabitethernet 0/1 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan 10"

This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\nRun the Portnox Cloud local TACACS+ server container\nIn this section, you will learn how to deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container locally to the Linux machine.\nCopy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three export commands. \nsudo export TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID sudo export TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE sudo export TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=copied_TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN\nRun the portnox/portnox-tacacs Docker container. \nsudo docker run -d -p 49:49/tcp \\ --name portnox-tacacs --restart=always \\ -v portnox-tacacs-data:/data \\ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE=$TACACS_GATEWAY_PROFILE \\ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID=$TACACS_GATEWAY_ORG_ID \\ -e TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN=$TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN \\ portnox/portnox-tacacs:latest\nNote: The -v option creates and mounts a Docker volume that preserves the local TACACS+ server data in case the container stops running, for example, if the machine is restarted or crashes. Without this option, local TACACS+ cached data would be lost if the container stops running. To learn more about Docker volumes and an alternative, bind mounts, see Docker documentation.\nOptional: View the logs for the portnox/portnox-tacacs Docker container. \nsudo docker logs portnox-tacacs -f\nResult: Your local TACACS+ server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nAutomatically update an existing local server container\nIn this section, you will learn how to automatically update your Docker container to the latest version by deploying another Docker container: portnox-autoupdate.\nImportant: The portnox-autoupdate Docker container automatically updates all Portnox Docker containers to their latest versions as soon as they are available. If you already installed the portnox-autoupdate Docker container to automatically update another Portnox Docker container, you do not need to install it again.\nFind the organization ID: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to . \nIn the Self Onboarding section, see the URL that is displayed. \nNote: If self-onboarding is not activated, click on the Edit link and temporarily turn it on to see the URL.\nThe organization ID is the last part of the URL, after the last / symbol.\nFor example, if the URL is https://user-registration.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76, then the organization ID is b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nGet an API token from Portnox Cloud: \nIn Portnox Cloud, go to \nClick on the Generate token link. \nIn the GENERATE A NEW TOKEN window, enter the name for the token that describes its purpose and click on the Generate token button. \nClick on the ⧉ button to copy the code and store it in a safe place. \nImportant: You will not be able to access this code again after closing this window.\nDeploy the portnox-autoupdate Docker container: \nsudo docker run --restart=always -d --name portnox-autoupdate \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ -v portnox-autoupdate-logs:/app/logs \\ -e AUTO_UPDATE_ORG_ID=your_organization_ID \\ -e AUTO_UPDATE_PORTNOX_API_TOKEN=your_API_access_token \\ portnox/portnox-autoupdate:latest\nFor example:\nsudo docker run --restart=always -d --name portnox-autoupdate \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ -v portnox-autoupdate-logs:/app/logs \\ -e AUTO_UPDATE_ORG_ID=b2973887-1274-45c4-91d0-4a342a861c76 \\ -e AUTO_UPDATE_PORTNOX_API_TOKEN=zZD0XR18UmNc8gG1TRt9ZyMhHnl \\ portnox/portnox-autoupdate:latest"

  "text": "Guest access – Extreme WiNG\nIn this topic, you will learn how to configure Extreme WiNG to work together with the Portnox™ Cloud captive portal for guest user authentication.\nBefore you begin configuring your controller, you must configure the guest network in Portnox Cloud and note down the values of the fields: IP (for walled garden) and Captive Portal URL. You will need these values later. We recommend that you keep your Portnox Cloud configuration open in another browser tab for easy copying and pasting.\nImportant: This guide provides general instructions for integrating Portnox Cloud with specific third-party devices. While we aim to provide helpful examples for commonly used models, configurations may vary across manufacturers, models, and environments. As a result, we cannot guarantee that these steps will work in every scenario. For questions or issues related to RADIUS setup – which is an industry standard and not specific to Portnox – or device-specific settings and troubleshooting, we recommend consulting the device manufacturer’s documentation and contacting their support team. While Portnox Support is happy to assist where possible, please note that detailed configuration of third-party devices is typically best handled by the manufacturer.\nNote: This setup was tested on a WiNG VX 9000 virtualized software-based controller and the WiNG AP 7632 access point. You can set up the captive portal either on the controller, as in this example, or directly on an access point.\nIn the WiNG web interface, navigate to: and in the Captive Portal Policy field, enter a new captive portal policy name. \nIn the Basic Configuration tab: \nIn the Captive Portal Server Mode field, select the Internal (Self) option. \nIn the Connection Mode field, select the HTTPS option. \nIn the Security section below, in the AAA Policy field, click on the 🗎+ icon. \nResult: The AAA Policy window opens.\nIn the AAA Policy field, enter a name for this AAA policy. \nIn the RADIUS Authentication tab, click on the Add button below to add a new server entry. \nResult: The Authentication Server window opens.\nIn the Authentication Server window: \nIn the Server Type field, select the Host option. \nIn the Host field, select the IP Address option and type the Cloud RADIUS IP displayed in the Cloud RADIUS instance section of Portnox Cloud (). \nIn the Port field, type the Authentication port displayed in the same Portnox Cloud section. \nIn the Secret field, type the Shared Secret copied from the same Portnox Cloud section using the ⧉ icon. \nIn the Request Proxy Mode, select the through-centralized-controller option if you are using a centralized controller (such as the VX 9000 that we used in this example). \nClick on the OK button in the bottom-right corner to save the server configuration and close the Authentication Server window. \nOptional: Repeat the two steps above to add the second Cloud RADIUS authentication server, if desired. \nClick on the RADIUS Accounting tab, then click on the Add button below to add a new server entry. \nResult: The Accounting Server window opens.\nIn the Accounting Server window: \nIn the Server Type field, select the Host option. \nIn the Host field, select the IP Address option and type the Cloud RADIUS IP displayed in the Cloud RADIUS instance section of Portnox Cloud (). \nIn the Port field, type the Accounting port displayed in the same Portnox Cloud section. \nIn the Secret field, type the Shared Secret copied from the same Portnox Cloud section using the ⧉ icon. \nIn the Request Proxy Mode, select the through-centralized-controller option if you are using a centralized controller (such as the VX 9000 that we used in this example). \nClick on the OK button in the bottom-right corner to save the server configuration and close the Accounting Server window. \nOptional: Repeat the two steps above to add the second Cloud RADIUS authentication server, if desired. \nClose the AAA Policy window by clicking on the Exit button. \nIn the AAA Policy field, select the policy that you have just created. \nIn the Access section, in the Access Type field, select the RADIUS Authentication option. \nScroll down to the DNS whitelist section, and in the DNS Whitelist field, click on the 🗎+ icon. \nResult: The window for editing DNS whitelist entries opens.\nIn the whitelist entry list window: \nIn the Name field, enter the name for this DNS whitelist. \nClick on the Add Row button. \nIn the DNS Entry column, select the IPv4 Address option, and type the first IP (for walled garden) value from Portnox Cloud (). \nRepeat the two steps above for the second IP address. \nClick on the OK button in the bottom-right corner to save the configuration and close the DNS Whitelist window. \nIn the DNS Whitelist section, in the DNS Whitelist field, select the DNS whitelist that you have just created. \nOn the top of the Captive Portal Policy pane, click on the Web Page tab and then in the Web Page Source field, select the Captive_Portal_Webpage_External radio button. \nIn all URL fields, enter the Captive Portal URL from Portnox Cloud (). In the Welcome URL field, enter a URL that you want to show to the user after the user successfully authenticates. \nNote: WiNG configuration requires you to fill all URL fields, even if most of them are not used by the Portnox Cloud captive portal. That’s why we recommend using the same URL for all those fields.\nClick on the OK button in the bottom-right corner of the Captive Portal Policy pane to save the configuration. \nIn the WiNG web interface, navigate to: . \nClick on the Add button on the bottom of the table to add a new wireless LAN. \nIn the Basic Configuration pane: \nIn the WLAN field, enter a name for this WLAN configuration (it doesn’t have to be the same name as the SSID but we recommend that you use the same name, so that you can easily identify your WLAN later). \nIn the SSID field, enter a SSID for this WLAN. \nIn the WLAN Status field, make sure that the Enabled button is selected. \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the Security option, and then in the Security pane: \nIn the Select Authentication section, select the PSK / None radio button. \nIn the WLAN_Captive_Portal section, activate the Captive Portal Enable checkbox. \nIn the Captive Portal Policy field, select the captive portal policy that you created earlier. \nClick on the OK button in the bottom-right corner to save the WLAN configuration. \nIn the WiNG web interface, navigate to: and then click on the name of the profile for the access point model that you want to work with your WLAN. \nIn this example, we selected the AP 7632 profile because we were configuring the AP 7632 model.\nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the option and then click on the radio (frequency) that you want to configure with your new WLAN. \nResult: The Radios window opens.\nIn the Radios window, switch to the WLAN Mapping / Mesh Mapping tab, and use the < button to move your WLAN from the WLANs list on the right-hand side to the Radio list on the left-hand side. \nClick on the OK button in the bottom-right corner to save your radio configuration. \nOptional: Repeat the steps above for the other radios on the same access point, if needed. \nIn the left-hand side menu, click on the option and then in the Profile_Captive_Portal field, activate the checkbox next to the name of the captive portal policy that you created earlier. \nClick on the OK button in the bottom-right corner to save your access point configuration. \nClick on the Commit and Save button in the top-right corner to save and commit your changes to your WiNG equipment configuration."

  "text": "Certificate fragmentation issues\nIn this topic, you will learn how to address fragmentation issues when onboarding devices onto a network managed by Portnox™ Cloud using certificates.\nIf certificate-based authentication does not work but credential-based authentication works, check if the packets are being fragmented by firewalls/routers between the NAS and the RADIUS server. You can do this by obtaining a packet capture of the communication between the NAS device and the Cloud RADIUS service.\nFragmentation happens because Ethernet frames have a maximum size, called the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), which is limited to 1500 bytes. Certificates, however, are sometimes much larger than this limit. When a certificate is too big to fit within a single frame, the router or firewall will try to split it into smaller pieces, sending the data across multiple frames. Unfortunately, when the certificate is in separate pieces, the smaller fragments are often eliminated by DDoS protection mechanisms, so the server isn’t able to put them back together correctly and doesn’t recognize the certificate as valid.\nThe following are potential options to resolve such fragmentation problems:\nReduce the key size of the certificate and eliminate any unnecessary information from the certificate (for example, OCSP or CRL information). If you remove any unnecessary information from the certificate, it may be small enough to fit in a single frame.\nReduce the key size of your certificates, for example, set it to 1024. This value is configured when generating the certificate, for example, in your SCEP profiles if you use Intune, Jamf, or another UEM platform to generate your certificates, and it’s often set to be 2048 or 4096. This will also reduce the packet size, so certificates will fit in a single frame.\nUse ECC encryption to generate your certificates, not the default RSA, if possible. ECC is better, stronger, and much more efficient (requires fewer bytes) than RSA, so resultant certificates will be smaller and will be more likely to fit within a single frame even with extra information.\nUse RadSec (secure RADIUS) to communicate to Cloud RADIUS servers. RadSec is immune to frame size issues. Unfortunately, while RadSec is quite common, it may be unsupported by some NAS devices, so check manufacturer information for your model.\nInstall a local RADIUS server and use it as a proxy to the Cloud RADIUS servers. The local RADIUS server communicates with Cloud RADIUS servers using different protocols so the frame size problem does not apply – 802.1X communication happens only within your network.\nFor Palo Alto switches, try this solution.\nFor Cisco Internet SD-WAN connections, packet reassembly might cause the issue, which is resolved by issuing the following command on the interface level: no ip virtual-reassembly-out.\nFor Cisco switches also consider disabling jumbo frames.\nFor Meraki access points, consider activating the Dashboard RADIUS proxy option in the SSID configuration."

  "text": "Onboard Android devices with certificates using SOTI MobiControl and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud certificates to Android devices via SOTI MobiControl and SCEP.\nImportant: As of the moment of writing, SOTI MobiControl only supports Windows and Android devices with Portnox Cloud SCEP servers. SOTI MobiControl allows you to manage also macOS, and iOS devices, but there are issues in the SOTI MobiControl administrative interface that prevent it from working with the Portnox Cloud SCEP servers. If you need an option to manage devices other than Windows or Android, please contact SOTI for an update on when these issues will be resolved.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the later steps.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nYou need the root CA certificate so that your managed devices can verify the validity of Cloud RADIUS servers, which have certificates signed by this root CA certificate. If the root CA certificate is not distributed to managed devices, some devices may show a security warning each time that the user connects to networks managed by Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk to use it later. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nCopy the tenant CA certificate thumbprint from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will copy the tenant CA certificate thumbprint from the Cloud portal and save it, so you can use it later in SOTI MobiControl configuration.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nIn the Trusted Root Certificates section, select the value of the Thumbprint next to the certificate that you are currently using (if more than one) and use your operating system’s copy function to copy this value to the clipboard. \nSave the value from the clipboard in a temporary text file to use it later during configuration. \nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the SOTI MobiControl team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure SOTI MobiControl to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and SOTI MobiControl , here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the Base-64 encoded X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nThe thumbprint of the tenant CA certificate. For example, 6E138176256057344FEA53BDDAD3D0F6BF2D90F3.\nCreate the SCEP CA configuration and the SCEP request template\nIn this section, you will create the SCEP CA configuration and the SCEP request template in SOTI MobiControl. This configuration and this template will be used by the profiles that you will create later.\nOpen your SOTI MobiControl tenant dashboard in your browser, and log in as the administrator. \nIn the Certificate Authority window, click on the + button. \nIn the CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY window: \nIn the Name field, enter a name for this configuration. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Certificate Type field, select the ADCS option. \nIn the Configuration Type field, select the SCEP option. \nActivate the Use SCEP Client switch. \nIn the Service URL field, paste the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nActivate the Use Static Challenge switch. \nIn the Static Challenge field, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Thumbprint field, paste the thumbprint value that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nScroll down the CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY window to the Certificate Templates section and click on the + button. \nIn the Template Details section: \nIn the Name field, type a name for this template. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP Template, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Subject Name field, enter the value for the Subject of the certificates issued by the SCEP server. \nImportant: The value that you use in this field is the value that you will see on your Devices screen in Portnox Cloud for the Portnox account that will be created for the device. You can create the Portnox accounts manually for each device or create rules in Portnox Cloud so that these Portnox accounts are created for each new device that attempts to connect. You can use any unique value that you like, for example, the serial number or the MAC address of the device.\nIn this example, we used the format CN=%SERIALNUM%, which generates the subject name on the basis of the device serial number.\nIn the Certificate Target field, select the Device option. \nTurn off the Provision Certificate to Authenticated Users Only switch. \nTurn on the Preserve Private Key switch. \nIn the Certificate Usage field, select the Signing and Encryption option. \nIn the Key Size field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nTurn on the Remove old certificates upon successful renewal switch and the Use Automatic Renewal switch. \nIn the Days Before Automatic Renewal field, we recommend that you select at least 14 DAYS. \nClick on the ADD button to save the template. \nClick on the SAVE button to save the SCEP configuration. \nResult: You created a configuration for the Portnox Cloud SCEP CA and the SCEP request template.\nCreate a profile for Android\nIn this section, you will create a profile in SOTI MobiControl for Android devices. This profile will contain the necessary certificates as well as SCEP and Wi-Fi configurations.\nIn the top-right corner of the Profiles pane, click on the NEW PROFILE button. \nIn the ADD PROFILE window, click on the Android icon, and then select the type of profile that your Android devices use. \nNote: Android devices can be managed using three different profile types. Work Managed is a profile where the entire device is owned by the enterprise and managed by the enterprise. Work Personal is a personal device that has a separate work profile, which is managed by the enterprise. Corporate Personal is a device owned and managed by the enterprise, where the user has a separate personal profile not managed by the enterprise and not accessible to the enterprise.\nImportant: You must select the type of profile that your Android devices use. If you have Android devices with different profile types, you must create a separate Android profile in SOTI for each of these profile types.\nIn the CREATE PROFILE window, in the GENERAL tab, in the Profile Name field, enter a name for the profile. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud Android Profile, but you can use any name you like.\nClick on the CONFIGURATIONS tab and then click on the + button in the top-right corner. Then, select the Certificates option. \nIn the Certificates window, in the Add Certificates row, click on the button on the right-hand side to import a new certificate. \nIn the Add Certificate window, click on the Browse button, find the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier from Portnox Cloud, and then click on the IMPORT button. \nIn the Certificates window, activate the switches next to the DigiCert Trusted Root G4 certificate (root CA certificate) and the SCEP request template that you added earlier. Then, click on the Save button. \nIn the CONFIGURATIONS tab, click on the + button in the top-right corner. Then, select the WiFi option. \nIn the WIFI window: \nIn the Network Name field, enter the SSID of your network managed by Portnox Cloud. \nTurn on the Set as Active Network switch. \nIn the Security Type field, select the 802.1x Enterprise option. \nExpand the Protocols section. \nIn the Accepted EAP Types section, activate the TLS checkbox. \nExpand the Authentication section. \nIn the User Identity Certificate section, select the SCEP request template that you added earlier. \nIn the CA Certificate section, select DigiCert Trusted Root G4 (the root CA certificate that you uploaded earlier). \nIn the Phase 2 Authentication field, select the None option. \nIn the Anonymous Identity field, type any identifier you like. \nNote: The anonymous identity string is required by some Android devices. This is an identifier that these devices use when connecting to the network and it can be any string of characters you like that identifies your group of devices.\nIn the Domain field, type: clear-rad.portnox.com. \nClick on the Save button to save the Wi-Fi profile. \nIn the CONFIGURATIONS tab, click on the + button in the top-right corner. Then, select the Authentication option. \nIn the AUTHENTICATION window, configure your device authentication policy according to your preferences. \nNote: This configuration is not required by Portnox Cloud but it is required by SOTI MobiControl if you add certificates. Therefore, you must add this payload but you can configure it any way you like.\nClick on the SAVE AND ASSIGN button to save your configuration profile and assign it to your managed devices. \nResult: You created a profile for Portnox Cloud and Android devices.\nAfter you created your profile, you can use your regular SOTI MobiControl procedures to push it to managed devices immediately and see if it works correctly. For information on managing devices, pushing profiles, and troubleshooting, consult the SOTI MobiControl documentation."

  "text": "Onboard macOS devices with certificates using Jamf and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud certificates via Jamf and SCEP to manage macOS devices.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the later step in which you get the Cloud SCEP URL and password.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nImportant: This topic shows the configuration for macOS computers with macOS 12 (Monterey), but the Apple profile payloads Certificate, SCEP, and WiFi, which are used in this configuration, are compatible with the following Apple operating systems: iOS 4.0+, iPadOS 4.0+, macOS 10.7+, tvOS 9.0+, watchOS 3.2+. This means that you can use the same profiles to configure other Apple devices based on these operating systems, for example, iPhones.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate\nIn this section, you will download the root CA certificate from Portnox™ Cloud, which is needed to create a profile.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nClick on any of the RADIUS servers listed in the right-hand pane to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link. \nResult: The root CA certificate file is in the Downloads folder on the local disk.\nDownload the tenant CA certificate\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud tenant CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nYou need the tenant CA certificate from Portnox Cloud so that your managed devices can verify the validity of individual SCEP certificates, which are signed using the tenant CA certificate.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Trusted Root Certificates section, click on the Download CER link, then save the downloaded file. \nThe default name of the file is Your_tenant_name - Portnox CLEAR.cer, for example, Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR.cer.\nOptional: Rename the downloaded file to tenantCertificate.cer. This is the name used in the next part of this guide. \nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Jamf team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Jamf to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Jamf, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nThe tenant CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, tenantCertificate.cer.\nCreate a Jamf configuration profile\nIn this section, you will create a configuration profile in Jamf that lets managed devices get certificates from the Portnox™ Cloud SCEP server.\nOpen your Jamf instance in the browser and log in. \nFor example, vorlon.jamfcloud.com\nIn the top-left corner, click on the Computers icon. \nIn the left-hand menu, click on the Configuration Profiles option. \nJamf shows the Configuration Profiles pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the top-right corner of the Configuration Profiles pane, click on the New button. \nJamf shows the New macOS Configuration Profile pane on the right-hand side.\nIn the General pane on the right-hand side, configure general properties for the new profile: \nIn the Name field, enter the name for this SCEP configuration profile. \nWe used the name Vorlon SCEP but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Level field, select whether this profile will be applied on the Computer Level or User Level depending on whether you will be using device certificates or user certificates. \nNote: If you use user certificates, we recommend that you select User Level in this field. However, If you prefer to use user certificates with Device Level, make sure that the Email Address field is populated correctly in the device’s inventory record in Jamf ( or ).\nIn the left-hand menu of the configuration profile pane, click on the SCEP option. \nJamf shows the Configure SCEP pane on the right-hand side.\nOn the right-hand side, click on the Configure button to configure SCEP properties for the new profile: \nIn the URL field, enter the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Redistribute Profile field, change the value Never to at least a week or more. \nNote: This value specifies when (how many days before) Jamf redistributes profiles to onboarded devices if their SCEP certificates are about to expire. Distributing a profile causes the device to request a new SCEP certificate. If this setting is left at Never, once the SCEP certificate expires, the device will lose the connection to the network and you will have to manually redistribute its profile to request a new SCEP certificate.\nIn the Subject field, enter a string to use to generate the Subject field in the user/device certificates. \nThe string can contain Jamf variables. The following are recommendations, but you should select the correct variables depending on your environment, the way you want to use AgentP, and repository:\nFor macOS user certificates, we recommend that you use: CN=$EMAIL\nFor device certificates (macOS and iOS), we recommend that you use: CN=$DEVICENAME\nThese variables are processed by Jamf and replaced by the user’s email address ($EMAIL) or Jamf device name ($DEVICENAME). Portnox Cloud then uses the values from the certificate fields to create or align with an account in Cloud.\nIf you use an incorrect variable for user certificate, Cloud will not be able to align this information with information from the authentication repository, and it will create a new Portnox account instead of aligning it with an accounts from the authentication repository.\nIf you use device certificates, Jamf will not able to create LDAP accounts, only Portnox accounts for devices. As such, the Subject value should simply contain a human-readable device name, so that it is easy to read on the Devices screen.\nFor more information about Jamf variables, see Payload Variables for Mobile Device Configuration Profiles in the Jamf Pro Administrator’s Guide.\nImportant: If you use variables, make sure that the variable value is available. For example, if you use the $USERNAME variable, make sure that there is a valid user account on the device that is also known to Jamf. If not, the device may report the following error: Unable to obtain certificate from SCEP server. Such errors are known to happen for example when devices are recycled (previously assigned to users that are no longer with the company).\nIn the Subject Alternative Name Type field, select the Uniform Resource Identifier option. In the Subject Alternative Name Value, enter https://jamfdeviceid/$UDID if you manage macOS devices or https://jamfmobiledeviceid/$UDID if you manage iOS devices, and in the NT Principal Name field, enter $EMAIL for user-based accounts or leave the field empty for device-based accounts. \nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field (NT Principal Name field in macOS). You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nIn the Challenge Type field, select Static, and in the Challenge and Verify Challenge fields, paste the password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Key Size field, select the key size that you want to use. \nIn this example, we used the value 2048 but you can use 1024 or 4096. Note that while higher values provide more security, values other than 1024 may cause certificate fragmentation problems in some network topologies. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nActivate the Use as digital signature and Use for key encipherment checkboxes. \nActivate the Allow all apps access checkbox. \nNote: This setting allows for unattended onboarding. If you do not activate this option, macOS will show a window asking for the administrator’s user name and password during onboarding.\nClick on the Upload Certificate button, then on the Choose File button, and select the tenant CA certificate file you saved earlier, then click on the Upload button. \nIn the left-hand menu of the configuration profile pane, click on the Certificate option. \nJamf shows the Configure Certificate pane on the right-hand side.\nOn the right-hand side, click on the Configure button to configure certificate properties for the new profile: \nIn the Certificate Name field, enter a display name for the root CA certificate. \nWe used the name Root CA but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Select Certificate Option field, select Upload. \nClick on the Upload Certificate button. Then, in the Certificate pop-up, click on the Choose File button, and select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier, for example, rootCertificate.cer. Then, click on the Upload button. \nClick on the + button in the top-right corner of the Certificate pane to add another certificate payload.

Then, in the Certificate pop-up, click on the Choose File button, and select the tenant CA certificate file you saved earlier, for example, tenantCertificate.cer. Then, click on the Upload button. \nNote: You don’t have to include the tenant CA certificate in the profile. However, if you don’t distribute the tenant CA certificate to managed devices, the SCEP certificates that your devices will generate on the basis of this tenant CA will be marked in the key chain as untrusted.\nClick on the Save icon in the bottom-right corner to save the configuration profile. \nConfigure the profile for Wi-Fi\nIn this section, you will edit the configuration profile and add a Wi-Fi network configuration. This will let your managed devices access the Wi-Fi network configured in Portnox™ Cloud by using certificates obtained from the Portnox SCEP server.\nIn the top-left corner, click on the Computers icon. \nIn the left-hand menu, click on the Configuration Profiles option. \nJamf shows the Configuration Profiles pane on the right-hand side.\nFind the profile that you created earlier and click on its name. \nIn the bottom-right corner of the right-hand side pane, click on the Edit icon. \nIn the left-hand menu of the right-hand side pane, click on the Network option. \nJamf shows the Configure Network pane on the right-hand side.\nOn the right-hand side, click on the Configure button to configure network properties for the new profile: \nIn the Network Interface field, select the Wi-Fi option. \nIn the Service Set Identifier (SSID) field, enter the SSID of the Wi-Fi network that you configured in Portnox Cloud for your managed devices. \nActivate the Disable MAC Address Randomization checkbox. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nIn the Security Type field, select the WPA/WPA2 Enterprise option. \nIn the Protocols tab of the Network Security Settings section in the right-hand side pane, in the Accepted EAP Types field, activate only the TLS checkbox. \nIn the Trust tab of the Network Security Settings section in the right-hand side pane, in the Identity Certificate field, select the SCEP option. \nIn the Trusted Certificates section, click on the checkboxes next to the display names of the certificates that you uploaded earlier. \nIn the CERTIFICATE COMMON NAME section, click on the Add button and add the following name: clear-rad.portnox.com. Then, click on the Save button. \nClick on the Save icon in the bottom-right corner to save the configuration profile. \nConfigure the profile for Ethernet\nIn this section, you will edit the configuration profile and add an Ethernet network configuration.

You can distribute such registry key values using Intune, too. To learn about the available values and their significance, see the following topic: AgentP configuration/installation options.\nFor each registry value that you want to add, prepare a PowerShell script to add the value. \nOpen a text editor such as Notepad and create a new text file with the following content. Replace value_name with the name of the value and value_data with the value.\nNew-Item -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP\" -Force | Out-Null; ` Set-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Portnox AgentP\" -Name ` \"value_name\" -Value \"value_data\"\nThen, save the file as a .ps1 script.\nNote: You can add all registry values in a single script but we recommend one script per registry value. This will let you apply different values to different devices, if needed.\nIn Intune, go to the following pane: . Then, click on the Platform scripts tab, and then click on the +Add button to add a new script. \nFollow the wizard steps to add the script. You can choose any name you like for the script configuration. Then, browse for the .ps1 file that you saved and assign the script to users/devices as needed. \nResult: You created a Windows AgentP app profile in Intune and assigned it to devices."

If you want to use only devices enrolled using device enrollment, complete the previous task instead.\nOpen the Microsoft Intune portal in your browser: intune.microsoft.com. \nIn the Devices | Configuration pane, in the Policies tab, click on the Create button and select the New Policy option. \nIn the Create a profile pane: \nIn the Platform field, select macOS. \nIn the Profile type field, select Templates \nIn the search bar, type scep. \nIn the Template name field, click on the SCEP certificate option. \nClick on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the SCEP certificate wizard, in the Name field, type a name for this profile, optionally fill in the Description field, and click on the Next button. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP User macOS, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Configuration settings step of the SCEP certificates wizard, fill in the fields as follows, and then click on the Next button. \nAdjust the proposed values to your requirements and your environment, if needed.\nIn the Deployment Channel field, select User Channel. \nIn the Subject name format field, enter the variables that Intune will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the format CN={{UserPrincipalName}}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the user’s principal name.\nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the attributes and the values that Intune will use to fill the SAN fields of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the attribute URI with the value https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}}, and the attribute User principal name (UPN) with the value {{UserPrincipalName}}.\nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field. You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nImportant: We strongly recommend adding the URI SAN with the https://intunedeviceid/{{DeviceId}} value, which is the device identifier. This allows Portnox Cloud to recognize situations where one device has multiple network interfaces (a Wi-Fi interface, an Ethernet interface, etc.), so that it is treated as a single device and consumes only one license. Without this attribute, agentless devices with multiple interfaces will consume separate licenses for each interface. This attribute is also used for risk assessment policies in Portnox Cloud – it lets Portnox Cloud assess the device risk and apply suitable actions.\nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Root Certificate section, click on the Root Certificate link and select the tenant CA certificate profile that you created in the earlier task. \nNote: Do not select the root CA certificate here.

Do not select the tenant CA certificate here. The tenant CA certificate is used in SCEP profiles to verify the validity of SCEP certificates.\nIn the Certificates section below, click on the Certificates link and select the profiles you created earlier: the device profile or the user profile. \nImportant: You can only select one authentication profile for the Wi-Fi network, so if you need to authenticate both user devices and dedicated devices, you need to use two different SSIDs and two Wi-Fi configurations.\nFor other fields, leave the default values or adjust values to your requirements and your environment, if needed. \nImportant: If you want to modify the default value of the Certificate validity period field, make sure that it is the same or less than the value in Portnox Cloud: .

However, Android requires HTTPS.\nTo make HTTPS requests to the Portnox cloud SCEP server, all your devices must have the SCEP server’s intermediate certificate to validate the SCEP server’s identity. The Portnox Cloud SCEP server’s intermediate certificate is the standard Thawte TLS RSA CA G1 certificate.\nIn many cases, the operating system of the device already has this certificate installed as one of the standard certificates, and you do not need to upload it. However, it is safer to distribute the certificate to make sure that every device can connect using SCEP via HTTPS.\nDownload the Thawte TLS RSA CA G1 certificate from our documentation server: click here to download. \nOpen the Microsoft Intune portal in your browser: intune.microsoft.com. \nIn the Devices | Configuration pane, in the Policies tab, click on the Create button and select the New Policy option. \nIn the Create a profile pane: \nIn the Platform field, select Android Enterprise. \nIn the Profile type field, select the following, depending on whether you are creating the profile for fully managed devices or for personally-owned devices: \nor \nClick on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the Trusted certificate wizard, in the Name field, type a name for this profile, optionally fill in the Description field, and click on the Next button. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP Cert Android, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Configuration settings step of the Trusted certificates wizard, click on the 🗀 icon to open the downloaded Thawte TLS RSA CA G1 certificate file and click on the Next button. \nIn this example, the file has the name ThawteTLSRSACAG1.crt.\nIn the Assignments step of the wizard, use relevant options to assign this profile to specific groups or all users/devices, and then click on the Next button. \nIn the Review + create step of the wizard, review all the information, and then click on the Create button. \nResult: You created a trusted certificate profile for the Portnox Cloud SCEP server’s intermediate certificate.\nCreate a profile for SCEP device certificates\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Microsoft Intune for unique device certificates, which are generated by Portnox™ Cloud for the devices, and obtained through SCEP requests.\nImportant: You need to complete this task only if you want to use devices enrolled as Android Enterprise Corporate-owned dedicated devices.

This is the value that you should use. Otherwise, Cloud will be unable to recognize the devices, and instead of mapping them to device accounts from the authentication repository, it will create new Portnox accounts for them.\nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the attributes and the values that Intune will use to fill the SAN fields of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the attribute Email address with the value {{DeviceId}}@intunedevice.id, which is the recommended value.\nIn the Key usage field, select both available values. \nIn the Key size (bits) field, we recommend that you select the 2048 option. \nNote: If you’re likely to experience network packet fragmentation due to the structure of your network, for example, due to firewalls, choose 1024 instead to prevent issues due to fragmentation. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Hash algorithm field, select SHA-1. \nIf you are sure that all your device operating systems support newer and safer SHA-2 algorithm, you can select SHA-2 instead.\nIn the Root Certificate section, click on the Root Certificate link and select the tenant CA certificate profile that you created in the earlier task. \nNote: Do not select the root CA certificate here. The root CA certificate is used in the network profile to confirm the identity of the Cloud RADIUS servers.\nIn the Extended key usage section, in the Predefined values column, select the Client Authentication option. \nIn the SCEP Server URLs section, copy and paste the SCEP URL that you saved in the first task in this series. \nFor other fields, leave the default values or adjust values to your requirements and your environment, if needed. \nImportant: If you want to modify the default value of the Certificate validity period field, make sure that it is the same or less than the value in Portnox Cloud: . By default, both are set to 1 year (365 days).\nIn the Apps step of the wizard, decide if the user must approve connections for all apps or should Android grant connection permission silently for specific apps. Then, click on the Next button. \nIn the Assignments step of the wizard, use relevant options to assign this profile to specific groups or all users/devices, and then click on the Next button. \nIn the Review + create step of the wizard, review all the information, and then click on the Create button. \nResult: You created a profile for device certificates obtained through SCEP.\nCreate a profile for SCEP user certificates\nIn this section, you will create a profile in Microsoft Intune for unique user certificates, which are generated by Portnox™ Cloud for the users of devices, and obtained through SCEP requests.\nImportant: You need to complete this task only if you want to use devices enrolled as Android Enterprise Corporate-owned user devices. If you want to use only dedicated devices, complete the previous task only.\nOpen the Microsoft Intune portal in your browser: intune.microsoft.com. \nIn the Create a profile pane: \nIn the Platform field, select Android Enterprise. \nIn the Profile type field, select the following, depending on whether you are creating the profile for fully managed devices or for personally-owned devices: \nor \nClick on the Create button. \nIn the Basics step of the SCEP certificate wizard, in the Name field, type a name for this profile, optionally fill in the Description field, and click on the Next button. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Cloud SCEP User Android, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Configuration settings step of the SCEP certificates wizard, fill in the fields as follows, and then click on the Next button. \nAdjust the proposed values to your requirements and your environment, if needed.\nIn the Certificate type field, select User. \nIn the Subject name format field, enter the variables that Intune will use to fill the Subject name field of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the format CN={{UserPrincipalName}}, which generates the subject name on the basis of the user’s principal name.\nIn the Subject alternative name section, select the attributes and the values that Intune will use to fill the SAN fields of the certificate. \nIn this example, we used the attribute User principal name (UPN) with the value {{UserPrincipalName}}, and the attribute Email address with the value {{DeviceId}}@intunedevice.id.\nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field.

  "text": "Integrate with Datadog using a syslog forwarder and TLS\nIn this topic, you will learn how to send Portnox™ Cloud alerts to the Datadog SIEM solution using a syslog forwarder with TLS for increased security.\nNote: Portnox Cloud now has a direct Datadog integration, so this method is no longer recommended. However, we are keeping this documentation for reference purposes.\nTo integrate with Datadog using a syslog forwarder and TLS:\nDeploy a machine or a virtual machine as a syslog message collector.\nInstall syslog-ng (or similar software) on this machine and accept syslog events via TLS from Portnox Cloud.\nSend the syslog events to the Datadog HTTPS intake API via HTTPS.\nIn this example configuration, we are using a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure with syslog-ng and a TLS connection. Using this configuration, the entire communications is encrypted using TLS (Portnox Cloud to syslog collector) and HTTPS (syslog collector to Datadog).\nCreate a Linux virtual machine\nTo integrate with Datadog, you need to run syslog software on a physical or virtual machine, so that it can collect alert data from Portnox™ Cloud and send that data to Datadog. In this section, you will learn how to create and configure such a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure based on the Linux Ubuntu operating system.\nOpen the Azure Portal dashboard in your browser. \nIn the Azure services menu on your dashboard, click on the Create a Resource option. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type virtual machine and press the ↩ key. In the Virtual machine tile below, click on the Create button and select the Virtual machine option from the context menu. \nIn the Create a virtual machine pane, enter the details for your virtual machine and then click on the Create button to create it. \nNote: Select one of the available Linux images, for example, Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 and its parameters according to your business, access, and security needs. Since the parameters of the virtual machine greatly depend on your specific environment and needs, the guidance on these parameters is beyond the scope of this guide and you should treat the example below as a lab environment only.\nIn the virtual machine pane, click on the public IP assigned to this machine to open the Configuration pane for the IP address associated with the machine. \nIn the Configuration pane for the IP address of the virtual machine, in the DNS name label (optional) field, enter a unique name that will form part of the FQDN for your virtual machine, and then click on the Save button. \nIn this example, we used the name datadog but you can use any name you like.\nThe FQDN of your virtual machine is the label that you enter followed by the domain name shown under the DNS name label field. You can also see it on the Overview pane as DNS name.\nCreate a port rule to open port 6514. \nThis is the standard port used by syslog software to collect alerts from external sources such as Portnox Cloud using TLS. The virtual machine must be able to accept information from Portnox Cloud on this port. You can use a different port number than 6514, if needed, but then you have to modify the configuration of syslog-ng and Portnox Cloud.\nIn the virtual machine pane, in the left-hand side menu, click on the Network settings option. \nOn the right-hand side, click on the Create port rule button, and then select the Inbound port rule option from the context menu. \nIn the Add inbound security rule pane, fill in the following fields and then click on the Add button: \nIn the Source field, select IP Addresses\nIn the Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges, type 23.97.155.157, 52.168.164.222, 20.72.156.11, and 51.124.144.69 (these are the Portnox Cloud IP addresses from which information is sent to SIEM software)\nIn the Destination field, select Any\nIn the Destination port ranges field, type 6514\nIn the Protocol field, select TCP\nIn the Action field, select Allow\nGenerate a certificate for your syslog collector\nIn this section, you will use OpenSSL software on the virtual machine to generate a self-signed certificate, which Portnox Cloud will use to connect to the collector via TLS.\nIn the virtual machine pane, in the left-hand side menu, click on the Connect option. \nIn the Connect pane, select the preferred SSH connection method to connect to the virtual machine. \nNote: Since the connection method depends on your specific environment, needs, and software, the guidance on the specific method is beyond the scope of this guide. For example, you can use native SSH connection using PuTTY software on Windows and the local key downloaded while creating the virtual machine.\nOptional: If OpenSSL is not installed by default, in your SSH window, type the following commands: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install openssl to install OpenSSL. \nGenerate the certificate using OpenSSL by typing the following commands in your SSH window: \nNote: In this example, we use the /etc/ssl/ directory but you can use another directory if you like. However, you will need to adjust further configuration steps.\nType: cd /etc/ssl/ to change to the destination directory. \nType: sudo openssl genrsa -out mykey.key 2048 to generate a private key for your certificate. \nType: sudo openssl req -new -key mykey.key -out mycsr.csr to create a certificate request that uses the key that you just created. \nNote: You will be asked for details such as the country, city, and other information for the certificate. Enter information that is relevant to your business. When asked for the Common Name, enter the FQDN of your virtual machine, in this example: datadog.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com.\nType: sudo openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in mycsr.csr -signkey mykey.key -out mycert.crt to generate a certificate on the basis of the request that you just created. \nNote: This example certificate is valid for 1 year only. Adjust the parameters as needed.\nType: cat /etc/ssl/mycert.crt to print the certificate to the SSH console. Copy the entire text from the SSH console, paste it into a local text file, and save that file locally. \nYou will need this file to configure Portnox Cloud to communicate with the collector using TLS.\nIn this example, we saved the certificate as datadog-vm.crt.\nInstall and configure syslog-ng\nIn this section, you will install syslog-ng on the virtual machine, and configure it to accept events from the network via TLS and send them to Datadog via HTTPS.\nIn your SSH window, type the following commands: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install syslog-ng to install syslog-ng software. \nThen, type the following command: sudo nano /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf to edit syslog-ng configuration. \nFollow the steps described in the Datadog documentation for syslog-ng to add the following configuration sections to the syslog-ng.conf file but modify them as follows: \nAdd a new source definition to obtain logs from the network via port 6514 and TLS. \nsource s_tls { network( ip(0.0.0.0) port(6514) transport(\"tls\") tls( key-file(\"/etc/ssl/mykey.key\") cert-file(\"/etc/ssl/mycert.crt\") peer-verify(optional-untrusted) ) ); };\nThis source represents the logs incoming from Portnox Cloud through a TLS connection.\nNote: If you used different directory or file names when creating the private key and the certificate, adjust the paths in the configuration.\nDo not add the s_files source as described in Datadog documentation, because it is not needed if the logs are collected from an external source (Portnox Cloud). \nIn the destination section, add a pointer to the certificate authority file. \ndestination d_datadog { http( url(\"https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu/api/v2/logs?ddsource=<SOURCE>&ddtags=<TAG_1:VALUE_1,TAG_2:VALUE_2>\") method(\"POST\") ca-file(\"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\") headers(\"Content-Type: application/json\", \"Accept: application/json\", \"DD-API-KEY: DATADOG_API_KEY\") body(\"<${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST:--} ${PROGRAM:--} ${PID:--} ${MSGID:--} ${SDATA:--} $MSG\\n\") ); };\nNote: You don’t have to add the ca-file line unless you encounter certificate-related errors when trying to connect to the Datadog HTTPS intake.

  "text": "Deploy the local TACACS+ server container in Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local TACACS+ server container in Amazon Web Services (AWS) using AWS Fargate.\nTo deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container in AWS Container Instances, you must first configure the settings for the local TACACS+ server container and generate environment variables. To do it, go to the following topic: Run the local TACACS+ server in a container.\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nAWS Fargate is one of the options to deploy the local TACACS+ server container in AWS. Other options include using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or EC2 instances. If you choose a different option, please follow the relevant AWS documentation for your chosen method.\nIn order for the local TACACS+ server container in AWS to be able to communicate with your NAS devices in your local network, you must create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS and connect it to your local network. AWS offers many ways of achieving this. This topic is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find useful information in the following AWS documentation topic: Connect your VPC to remote networks using AWS Virtual Private Network.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local TACACS+ server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nWhen you’re using stateless containers and you want to update to a newer version of the Docker image, you need to delete the container and recreate it from scratch with the same parameters.\nCreate a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nIn this section, you will create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a private subnet for local TACACS+ server containers.\nNote: You can skip this section if you already have a Virtual Private Cloud with a subnet that you want to dedicate to your local TACACS+ server containers and relevant configuration. You can also add a new subnet to an existing VPC manually.\nIn the VPC dashboard pane, click on the Create VPC button to begin creating the VPC. \nIn the VPC settings section, select the VPC and more option. \nIn the Name tag auto-generation section, activate the Auto-generate checkbox and enter a prefix in the text field below. \nIn this example, we used the prefix portnox, but you can use any prefix you like.\nIn the IPv4 CIDR block field, enter the IPv4 CIDR block for your private network. \nIn this example, we used the 10.1.0.0/16 private network block but you can use any block you like. The default block offered by AWS is 10.0.0.0/16.\nIn the Number of Availability Zones (AZs) field, select 1. \nIn the Number of public subnets field, select 1 and in the Number of private subnets field, select 1. \nNote: You need the public subnet in AWS to connect the local TACACS+ server to the internet.\nIn the NAT gateways field, select the In 1 AZoption. \nIn the VPC endpoints field, select the None option. \nActivate the checkboxes: Enable DNS hostnames and Enable DNS resolution. \nClick on the Create VPC button below to create the VPC. \nCreate a task definition and a cluster\nIn this section, you will deploy the local TACACS+ server Docker container to the Virtual Private Cloud created in the previous step by creating a task definition and a cluster.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click on the Task definitions option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create new task definition button. \nIn the Create new task definition pane, in the Task definition family field, enter a name for your task definition. \nIn this example, we used the task name TACACS but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Infrastructure requirements section, in the Launch type field, select the AWS Fargate option and in the Operating system/Architecture field, select the Linux/X86_64 option. \nIn the section, in the Name field, enter a name for the container, and in the Image URI field, enter portnox/portnox-tacacs:latest. \nIn this example, we used the container name tacacs but you can use any name you like.\nIn the section, click on the Add environment variable button three times to add three environment variables. Then, copy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three Key and Value pairs. \nOptional: If you want to store the TACACS_GATEWAY_TOKEN value safely as a secret, you can use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: \nIn another browser tab, in the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand menu of the Systems Manager pane, select the option. \nClick on the Create parameter button. \nIn the Create parameter pane, in the Name field, enter a name for your parameter, for example tacacs_gateway_token. \nIn the Value field, paste the value of the token copied from Portnox Cloud. \nClick on the Create parameter button below. \nGo back to the task definition tab, and in the relevant environment variable, as the value enter ssm:/tacacs_gateway_token. \nScroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Create button. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click on the Clusters option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create cluster option. \nIn the Cluster name field, enter a name for your cluster, and in the Infrastructure section, select the AWS Fargate option. Then, click on the Create button below. \nIn this example, we used the cluster Portnox but you can use any name you like.\nAfter your cluster has been created successfully, in the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click again on the Task definitions option. \nIn the Task definitions pane, click on the name of the task definition you created earlier, and then click on the latest revision in the list of revisions. \nClick on the Deploy button in the top-right corner, and select the Run task option. \nIn the Create pane, in the Existing cluster field, select the cluster that you just created. \nScroll down to the Networking section and click on the heading to show the section. In the VPC field, select the virtual private cloud that you created earlier, in the Subnets field, select the subnets that you created together with the VPC, and in the Public IP section, turn the switch off. \nScroll all the way down and click on the Create button. \nAfter the deployment is complete, note down the Private IP address of the server. \nResult: Your local TACACS+ server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nCreate a private hosted DNS zone\nIn this section, you will create a private hosted DNS zone for your Virtual Private Cloud, which lets you configure your NAS devices to access the local TACACS+ server using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of its IP address.\nEvery time that you stop and restart your local TACACS+ server container in AWS, it may be assigned a different IP address on the subnet, which means you would have to reconfigure your NAS devices after every restart. Unfortunately, at this time, AWS does not offer any method to maintain a fixed IP address on its virtual private cloud.\nTo overcome this problem, you can configure a private hosted DNS zone in AWS, assign a private FQDN to the local TACACS+ server, and configure the NAS devices to access this server using this FQDN. This way, if you need to restart the container and get a different IP address, you can just change the IP address in the zone definition instead of having to reconfigure every NAS device.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Route 53 pane, click on the Hosted zones option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create hosted zone button. \nIn the Create hosted zone pane, in the Domain name, enter the local domain name that you want to use and in the Type section, click on the Private hosted zone option. \nIn this example, we used the domain vorlon.local but you can use any domain you like.\nIn the VPCs to associate with the hosted zone section, in the Region field, select the region in which you created your VPC earlier, and in the VPC ID field, select your VPC ID from the list. \nThen, click on the Create hosted zone button below to create the hosted zone. \nIn the pane that represents your newly created hosted zone, in the Records section, click on the Create record button. \nIn the Create record pane, in the Record name field, enter the name that you want to use for your local TACACS+ server host, in the Record type field, select the A – Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources option, and in the Value field, enter the IP address of your deployed local TACACS+ server container that you noted down in the previous task. \nIn this example, we used the tacacs record name to create a tacacs.vorlon.local record but you can use any record name you like.\nNote: If you didn’t note down the IP address earlier, open a new browser tab and check the address by going to \nThen, click on the Create records button below. \nResult: You can configure your NAS devices in the VPC to access the local TACACS+ server using its FQDN (in our example, tacacs.vorlon.local) in the VPC instead of its IP address (in our example, 10.1.136.187). You also need to configure the resolver in the NAS device to use one of the AWS DNS servers listed in the NS record, in the Value field.\nIf you need to restart the container and the IP address of the local TACACS+ server changes, change the IP address in the record that you created for your hosted zone."

This way, the user immediately loses access to the application if there is risk. They user may gain access again after remediating the cause of the risk.\nNote: If your session needs to be revoked due to one device becoming a security risk, all sessions on all devices will be revoked.

  "text": "Manage members of a group\nIn this topic, you will learn how to automatically manage members of a group in Portnox™ Cloud based on groups and/or organizational units in Portnox Cloud and/or authentication repositories.\nBefore you begin, you must create a group in Portnox Cloud. To create a group and configure its basic settings, read the following topic: Create a group.\nTo understand what are groups in Portnox Cloud and how they work together with accounts and policies, read the following topic: What are groups in Portnox Cloud?.\nThere are two ways in which you can manage the relationships between accounts and groups in Portnox Cloud:\nBy assigning individual accounts to groups.\nBy mapping directory groups and/or organizational units to groups in Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Groups option. \nClick on the ⋮ icon on the right-hand side of the selected group name and select the Group members option from the pop-up menu to begin the process of managing members of the selected group. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the heading that represents the repository you want to work with. \nPORTNOX REPOSITORY: Assign accounts created in Portnox Cloud to this group. If you select this option, you will be working with individual accounts, not groups. For example, contractor accounts that represent external contractors or MAC-based accounts that represent IoT devices.\nACTIVE DIRECTORY: Map Active Directory groups, accounts, and/or organizational units to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with a local AD instance (see: Integrate with Active Directory).\nENTRA ID: Map Entra ID groups, accounts, and/or organizational units to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with Entra ID (see: Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID).\nGOOGLE WORKSPACE: Map Google Workspace groups and/or accounts to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with Google Workspace (see: Integrate with Google Workspace).\nOKTA DIRECTORY: Map Okta Workforce Identity groups and/or accounts to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with Okta Workforce Identity (see: Integrate with Okta Wokforce Identity).\nOPEN LDAP: Map OpenLDAP groups, accounts, and/or organizational units to this group. To do this, first, you need to integrate Portnox Cloud with a local OpenLDAP instance (see: Integrate with OpenLDAP).\nNote: The list will contain only those external repositories that you integrated Portnox Cloud with.\nSelect the groups to map between the directory and this group. \nThe left pane shows directory groups available for mapping to this group. The right pane shows directory groups that are mapped to this group.\nClick on checkboxes next to group names to select them. \nYou can also start typing type name of the group in the search box on top of the pane. As you type, the list of group names shown in the panel will be restricted to only those that contain the text you are typing.\nClick on the right arrow or the left arrow symbol between panes to move selected groups between panes. \nIf you made any changes, the following buttons will appear under the panes: Reset changes and Save. Click on the Save button to save your changes or click on the Reset changes button to cancel your changes. \nOptional: Click on the Switch view option and select View OUs or View accounts to map organizational units or individual accounts between the directory and this group. \nIn addition to mapping by groups, you can also map individual user accounts or organizational units (OUs) to groups in Portnox Cloud.\nOrganizational units are available only if you selected the Use OU-based mapping option when configuring your integration, and only for Entra ID, local Active Directory, and OpenLDAP. Sub OUs are mapped along with primary OUs but in a flat structure, so we recommend using the search box to find a specific OU.\nIf you did not turn on mapping based on organizational units or your directory does not allow mapping based on organizational units, instead of the Switch view option, you will see a View accounts option to switch directly to the accounts view.\nImportant: If you select entries both from groups and organizational units, and some users are in both the selected groups and organizational units, when onboarding the user, Portnox Cloud will prioritize the authorization details of the group over those of the organizational unit. If you select individual accounts in addition to groups and/or organizational units, Cloud will prioritize individual accounts.\nRepeat the above steps for other authentication repositories if necessary. \nResult: You mapped selected directory groups and/or organizational units to this group. The first time that each user from a mapped group or organizational unit authenticates with Portnox Cloud, Cloud will make an account representing this user.\nNote: If you do not select the Allow life cycle synchronization option when setting up the integration, during synchronization Portnox Cloud will only add new users from the directory group or organizational unit and will not remove the accounts of users that are no longer in the directory group or organizational unit.\nNote: If you move users between LDAP groups, the up-to-date group members will only be visible in Portnox Cloud after you click the Force sync link on your authentication repository setup screen ()."

  "text": "Integrate with Rapid7 insightIDR\nIn this topic, you will learn how to send Portnox™ Cloud alerts to the Rapid7 insightIDR SIEM solution.\nCreate a Linux proxy virtual machine\nThe insightIDR architecture requires you to run the Collector component on a physical or virtual machine with the Linux or Windows operating system, so that it can collect alert data from Portnox™ Cloud and send that data to insightIDR. In this section, you will learn how to create and configure such a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure based on the Linux operating system.\nOpen the Azure Portal dashboard in your browser. \nIn the Azure services menu on your dashboard, click on the Create a Resource option. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type virtual machine and press the ↩ key. In the Virtual machine tile below, click on the Create button and select the Virtual machine option from the context menu. \nIn the Create a virtual machine pane, enter the details for your virtual machine and then click on the Create button to create it. \nNote: Select one of the available Linux images, for example, Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 and its parameters according to your business, access, and security needs, as well as insightIDR Collector requirements. Since the parameters of the virtual machine greatly depend on your specific environment and needs, the guidance on these parameters is beyond the scope of this guide and you should treat the example below as a lab environment only.\nIn the virtual machine pane, note down the public IP assigned to this machine. \nYou will need this public IP to configure Portnox Cloud to send alerts to the virtual machine.\nCreate a port rule to open port 10000. \nThis will be the port used by Collector to collect alerts from Portnox Cloud. The virtual machine must be able to accept information from Portnox Cloud on this port. The Linux version of the Collector requires you to use a port number higher than 1024. You can use a different port number than 10000, if needed, but then you have to modify the configuration of the insightIDR Event Source and Portnox Cloud.\nIn the virtual machine pane, in the left-hand side menu, click on the Network settings option. \nOn the right-hand side, click on the Create port rule button, and then select the Inbound port rule option from the context menu. \nIn the Add inbound security rule pane, fill in the following fields and then click on the Add button: \nIn the Source field, select IP Addresses\nIn the Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges, type 23.97.155.157, 52.168.164.222, 20.72.156.111, 51.124.144.69 (these are the Portnox Cloud IP addresses from which information is sent to SIEM software)\nIn the Destination field, select Any\nIn the Destination port ranges field, type 10000\nIn the Protocol field, select TCP\nIn the Action field, select Allow\nInstall and activate the Collector component\nIn this section, you will install the Collector component on the Linux virtual machine that you just created, and activate the Collector in insightIDR.\nIn the virtual machine pane, in the left-hand side menu, click on the Connect option. \nIn the Connect pane, select the preferred SSH connection method to connect to the virtual machine. \nNote: Since the connection method depends on your specific environment, needs, and software, the guidance on the specific method is beyond the scope of this guide. For example, you can use native SSH connection using PuTTY software on Windows and the local key downloaded while creating the virtual machine.\nLog in to your insightIDR instance and in the left-hand side menu, click on the DATA COLLECTION option. \nIn the top menu of the Data Collection Management pane, click on the Setup Collector option and from the context menu, select the Download Collector option. \nFind out the URL to download the Linux Collector to the virtual machine. \nThe URL is not directly presented by insightIDR. Here are suggestions of how to download the Collector to the virtual machine:\nSniff the URL using the Inspect mode.\nTurn on the Inspect mode in your browser. For example, in Chrome, right click on the browser window and choose the Inspect option.\nIn the inspect window, go to the Network tab. Then, click on the Download Linux Collector button.\nThe Network tab will have a new entry of the Document type called InsightSetup-Linux64.sh. Right-click on this entry and from the context menu select the option.\nThen, in your SSH window, paste the copied link into the wget command (wget copied link) to download the installation script.\nOtherwise, click on the Download Linux Collector button and then use third-party software to send the file to your virtual machine.\nIn your SSH window, type the following command: chmod +x InsightSetup-Linux64.sh to make the script executable. \nThen, type the following command: sudo ./InsightSetup-Linux64.sh to run the installer. \nFollow the steps of the installer carefully. In the last step, copy the value presented as Agent key and leave your SSH window open. \nIn your browser, go back to the Data Collection Management pane, then click on the Setup Collector option and from the context menu, select the Activate Collector option. \nNote: If the Activate Collector option is greyed out, it means that the Collector on the virtual machine did not establish a connection with insightIDR yet. Such connection may take a minute or so.\nIn the Activate collector pane, in the Collector Name field, enter a name for this collector, and in the Activation Token field, paste the Agent key value copied earlier. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox, but you can use any name you like.\nWait until the Collector is registered. This may take a few minutes. \nResult: The Collector is registered.\nConfigure an insightIDR event source for Cloud alerts\nIn this section, you will learn how to configure an Event Source in insightIDR, which will be used by the Collector to receive and parse alert information from Portnox Cloud.\nLog in to your insightIDR instance and in the left-hand side menu, click on the DATA COLLECTION option. \nIn the top menu of the Data Collection Management pane, click on the Setup Event Source option and from the context menu, select the Add Event Source option. \nIn the top menu of the Add Event Source pane, click on the Add Raw Data button and from the context menu, select the Custom Logs option. \nIn the Add Event Source pane, set up the new event source: \nIn the Name Event Source, enter a name for the new event source. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Select a Collector field, select the collector you just registered. \nIn the Collection Method section, click on the Listen on Network Port button. \nIn the Enter Port Number field, enter 10000. \nThe Linux version of the Collector requires you to use a port number higher than 1024. You can use a different port number than 10000, if needed, but then you have to modify the configuration of the virtual machine firewall and Portnox Cloud.\nIn the Protocol field, select the TCP option. \nClick on the Save button to add the new event source. \nResult: Your Event Source is active. You can see it by clicking on the DATA COLLECTION option in the left-hand side menu, and then in the top menu of the Data Collection Management pane, clicking on the Event Sources tab.\nConfigure Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will learn how to configure Portnox™ Cloud to send alert data to the Collector so that the data can be collected by Rapid7 insightIDR.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand menu, click on the option. \nCreate a new SIEM integration with insightIDR via the Collector. \nIn the SIEM integration service section, click on the Add new SIEM link. \nThe NEW SIEM INTEGRATION section opens.\nIn the Type field, select the Custom option. \nIn the Name field, enter the name for the new integration. \nIn this example, we used the name InsightIDR but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Status field, select the Enabled option. \nIn the Protocol type field, select the Syslog over TCP option. \nIn the IP field, enter the public address of your Linux virtual machine. \nIf you followed this guide from the beginning and created the virtual machine in Azure, this is the IP address that you copied earlier.\nIn the Port field, type 10000. \nThis is the port number that you opened on the virtual machine, which is the standard port number of the Sentinel connector.\nIn the Communication method field, select the Direct option. \nIn the Data format field, select the CEF option. \nClick on the Save button to add the integration. \nOptional: Test the configuration by clicking on the Test button. \nOptional: To configure the types of alerts sent to your SIEM solution, see the following topic: Portnox Cloud alerts. \nYou can also send all of the Portnox Cloud activity log (activities performed by administrators in Portnox Cloud) to your SIEM solution. To do this, go to , activate the Activity log switch, and click on the Save button.\nResult: Rapid7 insightIDR is receiving alerts from Portnox Cloud.\nYou can confirm that, for example, by running an insightIDR query."

To create a group and configure its basic settings, read the following topic: Create a group.\nNote: If you have not created any groups, you can edit the Default group. The Default group contains all accounts that are not assigned to other groups.\nTo understand what are groups in Portnox Cloud and how they work together with accounts and policies, read the following topic: What are groups in Portnox Cloud?.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Groups option. \nClick on the ⋮ icon on the right-hand side of the selected group name and select the Group settings option from the pop-up menu to begin the process of editing the selected group. \nYou can also delete the group by selecting the Delete group option. All the group settings will be lost and all accounts assigned to this group will be reassigned to the Default group.\nYou can also change the priority of groups by dragging and dropping the ⠿ icon. When a new user/account accesses the network, it will be assigned to the first group in ORDER listed here, where it matches the criteria.\nUsing this menu, you can also assign policies to the group. For more information, see the following topic: Assign policies to a group.\nIn the Automatic device onboarding section, click on the Enable automatic LDAP-based device onboarding checkbox to activate or deactivate it. \nIf this setting is turned on, Portnox Cloud will automatically create LDAP accounts for users authenticating for the first time on the basis of the integrated authentication repositories.\nImportant: This setting must be on if you want to map entire groups or organizational units from your integrated authentication repositories to Portnox Cloud. If this setting is not on, you will need to create each account in Portnox Cloud manually as a LDAP account and link it to the relevant entry in the authentication repository. \nIn the Device global settings section, edit the settings that apply to devices in this group independent on the network they are connected to: \nClick on the Instruct Portnox AgentP to collect device GPS location information checkbox to activate or deactivate it. \nIf this setting is on, and if geolocation collection was enabled during AgentP installation, AgentP will collect geolocation information from the device and make it available to Portnox Cloud. Geolocation information can be used for risk profiles.\nClick on the Automatically renew device certificate checkbox to activate or deactivate it. \nIf this setting is on, Portnox Cloud will automatically renew a device certificate for accounts in this group. Users will be informed about the availability of new certificates and will be able to download and install them.\nClick on the Unlimited checkbox to allow accounts in this group to have an unlimited number of devices or change the value in the field below to select a maximum number of devices allowed. \nIf the account already has a maximum number of devices allowed, as configured in the group, any new devices for this account will be denied network access.\nIn the AgentP settings section, click on the Allow enrollment only from specific OSs switch to activate or deactivate it. \nIf this setting is on, Portnox Cloud will allow accounts in this group to authenticate using AgentP only if the device has one of the selected operating systems. If the device has a deselected operating system, Portnox Cloud will deny it network access.\nIn the Allowed OS types field, click on the field to display the choices and then click on an entry to select it. Repeat for other entries if necessary. \nTo remove an entry, click on the x symbol next to the entry. \nIn the Authentication certificate section, select one of the available options: \nDefault root certificate generated by Portnox Cloud: Portnox Cloud will generate certificates for devices using the default tenant CA certificate. \nIssued by custom trusted root certificate: Portnox Cloud will generate certificates for devices using a custom CA certificate uploaded by a Cloud administrator.\nBefore you select this option, you must first upload the custom CA certificate to Portnox Cloud. You can do this in: . Only then the custom CA certificate will be available to select from the list.\nIn the 802.1X Wireless network access section, you can click on the Edit link next to a Wi-Fi network that you added before (see: Create a group), and configure additional advanced settings. \nClick on the ADVANCED CONFIGURATION (DEVICE PROVISIONING) heading to expand the section. \nIn the Authentication type field, select one of the available options. \nWhen the user is using the Portnox Cloud self-onboarding portal or when AgentP is being enrolled, the portal or the agent need to authenticate the user by communicating with relevant directory services. This field determines the protocol that is used during this authentication.\nPEAP-MSCHAPv2: Credential-based authentication, available only if you have configured integration with Active Directory services.\nEAP-TTLS/PAP: Credential-based authentication, available for LDAP servers other than Active Directory, such as OpenLDAP.\nEAP-TLS: Certificate-based authentication, available for all authentication repositories.\nOptional: Activate the Network Requires WPA3 192-bit Mode if you use AgentP and you want AgentP to configure your network adapter to connect to this Wi-Fi network using WPA3 in 192-bit mode. \nIn the 802.1X authentication mode (for Windows OS 10+ systems) section, select one of the available options. \nNote: These options let you decide how AgentP configures the network adapter when connecting to the secure network. They apply only if you choose EAP-TLS in the Authentication type field and only to devices with AgentP. For more information about this, see the following FAQ topic: AgentP and certificates.\nComputer authentication only: AgentP configures the network adapter to always use the certificate from the computer store. This means that the network adapter will use the same certificate when there is no logged-in user, and when a user is logged in, independent of what user is logged in.\nUser authentication only: AgentP configures the network adapter to use the certificate from the user store only. This means that when there is no logged-in user, the computer will not be able to access the networks protected by Portnox Cloud. When a user is logged in, the network adapter will use the certificate of the logged-in user. This setting should only be used for dedicated company devices used by one person only.\nUser or computer authentication (Recommended): AgentP configures the network adapter to use the certificate from the computer store when there is no logged-in user, and a certificate from the user store when a user is logged in. You can also use this setting for personal devices and for kiosk devices. This lets you switch between different modes of operation without the need to reconfigure Portnox Cloud.\nClick on the Save button to save the settings for this network or click on the Cancel button to abandon all changes. \nIn the 802.1X Wired network access section, click on the ADVANCED CONFIGURATION (DEVICE PROVISIONING) heading to expand the section. \nIn the Authentication type field, select one of the available options. \nWhen the user is using the Portnox Cloud self-onboarding portal or when AgentP is being enrolled, the portal or the agent need to authenticate the user by communicating with relevant directory services.

  "text": "Create a downloadable access control list (dACL) on a Cisco switch using the Policy Builder\nIn this topic, you will learn how to create downloadable access lists (dACLs) on Cisco switches using the Portnox™ Cloud dACL Policy Builder.\nNote: Portnox Cloud supports downloadable ACLs for most NAS devices from most popular manufacturers, not only Cisco.\nImportant: Portnox Cloud lets you create downloadable ACLs using either the DACL Policy Builder, as described here, or as a Custom dACL, where you can simply copy and paste your existing downloadable ACL that you have defined somewhere else.\nWarning: We tested this configuration on several models and several versions of Cisco switches but we cannot guarantee that it will cover every Cisco model. Therefore, to get the most accurate and current configuration guidance on dACL configuration, we strongly recommend that you refer to the documentation provided by Cisco on these topics for your particular device model.\nEnable IP device tracking. \nTo use dACLs on a Cisco switch, you must enable IP device tracking. This allows the switch to populate a source IP address (or destination dACL for return traffic) in the dACL. Without IP device tracking enabled, downloadable ACL assignment will not work.\nFor IOS version ≤ 15.0: IP device tracking is disabled by default.\nFor IOS version = 15.1: We could not find information regarding this version. We recommend entering the command to enable IP device tracking as a precaution.\nFor IOS version ≥ 15.2 with dot1x enabled, IP device tracking is enabled by default.\nEnter the following AAA commands in config mode. These commands are required for dACL assignment to work. \nradius-server vsa send authentication radius-server vsa send accounting aaa authorization network default group radius local\nConfigure the custom dACL in Portnox Cloud. \nImportant:\nThe source IP address must always be set to ANY (when configuring in Portnox Cloud, just leave it empty to set it to ANY). Cisco uses IP device tracking to auto-populate the source address and port in the dACL.\nThe first dACL rules must be set up to allow for DHCP traffic to be exchanged. This can be done by adding both DHCP UDP (68) and BootP UDP (67) ports. DHCP requests initiate on UDP port 67 but are changed by the DHCP server to UDP port 68 when responding. Without both these lines, a DHCP request will not be successful.\nThe last line of the dACL must be a DENY ALL or PERMIT ALL.

TACACS+ authorization policies let you define specific privileges of network administrators such as the ability to access specific services or run specific commands. These policies apply only to NAS devices, not to user devices.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Policies option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand menu, click on the TACACS+ AUTHORIZATION POLICIES tile. \nIn the right-hand side pane, click on the Create a new Policy link to create a new policy. \nNote: You can also click on the Edit link on the right-hand side of the selected line that represents an existing policy. The creation and editing processes are almost the same.\nIn the Policy Name field, enter the name for the new policy and in the Policy Description field, enter an optional description. \nOn the left-hand side, click on the Session-based > option, if you want to configure session-based TACACS+ authorization. \nSession-based authorization means that the NAS device will request TACACS+ authorization for the specific session. Once the session is authorized, NAS device administrator privileges depend on the authorized privilege level, configured on the NAS device.\nNote: The NAS device configuration decides whether it uses session-based or command-based authorization. You can define both session-based and command-based authorization in Portnox Cloud if you use both types in your NAS devices, but each NAS device will only use one of these two groups of settings.\nIn the Privilege level field, select the user privilege level. \nProfessional NAS devices can be configured to use 16 different privilege levels from 0 to 15. Each privilege level gives the NAS administrator access to specific commands and arguments. Privilege level 15 usually means full control of the NAS device. Many devices use three levels by default, where level 0 only allows a few commands, level 1 allows read-only access, and level 15 allows full control.\nIn the Session timeout field, select the session timeout in minutes. \nThe value 0 means no timeout. After the session timeout expires, the NAS device will either disconnect the administrator or reduce their privilege level. This behavior is configured on the NAS device.\nOptional: In the Autocommand field, enter the command that the NAS device will run immediately after the administrator is authorized. \nFor example, show running-config.\nIn the Allowed services section, click on the Add new link to add a new allowed service, enter the name of the service, and then click on the Add button. \nBy default, only the shell service is allowed but you can let the administrator access additional services like tty-server, connection, system, or firewall. If you remove all services, the administrator will have no privileges to access the NAS device.\nNote: If this setting conflicts with the privileges in the selected privilege level, the NAS device implementation decides which has higher priority.\nIn the Custom attributes section, click on the Add new link to add a new custom attribute as a Key and Value pair, and then click on the Add button. \nFor example, you can add standard TACACS+ attributes such as idletime or nohangup, as well as any attributes specific to your NAS devices.\nOn the left-hand side, click on the Command-based > option, if you want to configure command-based TACACS+ authorization. \nCommand-based authorization means that the NAS device will request TACACS+ authorization for each command that the NAS administrator tries to execute.\nNote: The NAS device configuration decides whether it uses session-based or command-based authorization. You can define both session-based and command-based authorization in Portnox Cloud if you use both types in your NAS devices, but each NAS device will only use one of these two groups of settings.\nActivate the Deny access to all commands by default checkbox if you want to allow administrators to use only selected commands. \nYou can use command-based authorization in a blacklist or whitelist mode.\nIf this setting is not activated, command-based authorization works in blacklist mode: you enter only the names of blacklisted commands.\nIf this setting is activated, command-based authorization works in whitelist mode: you enter only the names of whitelisted commands.\nIn the Forbidden/Allowed commands section, click on the Add new link to add a new command, enter the name of the command, and then click on the Add button. \nAll commands on this list will be treated as blacklisted or whitelisted, depending on the Deny access to all commands by default setting.\nIn the Custom attributes section, click on the Add new link to add a new custom attribute as a Key and Value pair, and then click on the Add button. \nFor example, you can add standard TACACS+ attributes such as idletime or nohangup, as well as any attributes specific to your NAS devices.\nTo save your policy settings, click on the Save button on the bottom right of the page. \nResult: You created or edited a TACACS+ authorization policy.

To get the most accurate and current configuration guidance on switch 802.1X configuration, we strongly recommend that you refer to the documentation provided by Dell on these topics for your particular device model and firmware version.\nImportant: All values in this configuration are examples. Make sure to adjust the configuration to your individual RADIUS server addresses, ports, and keys, as well as device interfaces, limits, and VLANs by replacing the values that are presented as underlined italics.\nSet all ports on the switch to force authorized (this includes Ten Gigabit interfaces, if applicable). \nImportant: This is a temporary step before you can turn on auto mode. If you do not set all the ports to force authorized before turning on dot1x authentication and setting up your RADIUS servers, all ports will be blocked. This includes your trunk and uplink ports, making the switch unreachable. To fix this, you would need to reboot the switch. This issue is specific to Dell switches.\nSet all standard Gigabit ports to force authorized using the range command. \ninterface range gi 1/1-1/48 dot1x port-control force-authorized exit\nRepeat the previous step for each switch in the stack (if not a single switch). \ninterface range gi 2/1-2/48 dot1x port-control force-authorized exit interface range gi 3/1-3/48 dot1x port-control force-authorized exit\nSet all Ten Gigabit ports to force authorized (depends on the switch number in the stack). \ninterface range Te 1/49-1/52 dot1x port-control force-authorized exit interface range Te 2/49-2/52 dot1x port-control force-authorized exit interface range Te 3/49-2/52 dot1x port-control force-authorized exit\nGlobally enable 802.1X on the switch or switch stack. \nConfirm that the switch remains up and working, then save the configuration. \nAdd global AAA commands that are not unique to the switch (Dell 3100 require very few AAA commands). \naaa accounting dot1x default start-stop radius\nAdd the Portnox Cloud US RADIUS server as the primary for authentication and accounting. \nImportant: The IP addresses, port numbers, and keys below are examples.

For more information about creating and editing the networks in the group, see the following topic: Create a group.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nIn the right-hand side pane, under the MAC-address-based onboarding heading, click on the Edit link below. \nClick on the Grant access to any device... checkbox to activate it. \nIf this setting is turned on, for each new device that connects to the network, Portnox Cloud will do the following:\nCreate a MAC-based account. The name of the account will be the name of the network adapter vendor, which is automatically identified using the MAC address.\nAssign the account to the Default group.\nAdd the device to this MAC-based account.\nIf agentless IoT device fingerprinting is on (), the name of the device will be automatically identified using the MAC address of its adapter.\nIf agentless IoT device fingerprinting is off, the name of the device will be the MAC address of its adapter.\nAs a result, the device will immediately have access to the network with privileges of the Default group. This will be confirmed by an 802.1X authentication success alert specifying the device connected via auto-onboarding.\nOptional: Click on the Automatically assign devices a VLAN, rather than the Portnox default group checkbox to activate it and enter the VLAN number in the adjacent field. \nIf this setting is turned on, new devices that connect to the network will be quarantined in the selected VLAN and the automatically created accounts will be treated as quarantine accounts.\nTo remove the device from quarantine and let it access the network, you have to manually add the device’s MAC address to another MAC-based account and delete the quarantine account.\nClick on the Save button to save your changes or click on the Cancel button to abandon all changes. \nAfter you click on one of the buttons, Portnox Cloud will exit the edit mode.\nNote: By default, if a device doesn’t connect to the network for 90 days, its MAC address is removed from the MAB account. You can change this period or disable this option here: . This does not mean that the device will be removed from the Portnox Cloud account. It means that if the device has been inactive for the configured period, and it tries to authenticate again after that period using its MAC address, it will no longer be recognized. The process for the Inactive MAC-addresses purge function is as follows: \nYou add a MAC address to a MAB account – the day when you do this counts as day 1.\nThe day counter increases every day at midnight tenant-time,\nAny time the device with the MAC address authenticates, the counter resets to 1.\nThe moment that the counter reaches the configured limit, the MAC address is removed from the MAB account.\nThe device with the MAC address is no longer in the MAB account so it cannot authenticate."

That is, at least one server must have the AD DS role. To learn more about AD DS, see Active Directory Domain Services Overview on Microsoft Learn.\nThe devices that you want to manage must be joined to the domain, and users that you want to manage must use domain credentials to log on to their devices.\nYou must have permission to edit the Group Policy in the domain.\nPerform the following tasks on your AD DS server.\nCreate and share a GPO folder\nIn this section, you will create a folder that contains AgentP installation files, and that will be used by other computers for installation.\nCreate a GPO directory in the local file system of the AD DS server. \nYou can create the directory with any name you like and anywhere in the local file system, as long as you be able to share the directory as a folder.\nFor example, create the directory C:\\GPO\\.\nDownload AgentP installation files for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows devices. \nOpen the AgentP download page (clear.portnox.com/agentinstall) in the browser on the AD DS server. \nScroll down to the Windows installation files and click on the tiles: Windows *.msi for x64 and Windows *.msi for x86. \nSave the downloaded files in the directory you created in the previous step. \nRename the files to remove the version number. \nThe files should be named PortnoxAgentP64.msi and PortnoxAgentP86.msi and should be located in the directory created earlier.\nShare the folder that you created previously. \nRight-click on the folder in the directory tree and select the Properties option from the context menu. \nIn the Properties window, click on the Sharing tab, and then click on the Advanced Sharing button. \nIn the Advanced Sharing window, activate the Share this folder checkbox, and then click on the Permissions button. \nIn the Permissions window, click on the Authenticated Users group, and make sure that the checkbox is activated in the Read permissions row and in the Allow column. \nClick on the OK button to close the Permissions window. \nClick on the OK button to close the Advanced Sharing window. \nIn the Properties window, click on the Security tab, click on the Domain Users group, and verify that there are check marks in the Allow column for the following rows: Read & execute, List folder contents, and Read. \nIf not, click on the Edit button to edit permissions.\nClick on the Close button to close the Properties window. \nResult: You shared a folder with AgentP installation files, which will be used by the GPO objects.\nCreate GPOs for 64-bit and 32-bit Windows\nIn this section, you will create a Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that will be used to automatically deploy AgentP on devices with 64-bit or 32-bit versions of Windows.\nRun the Group Policy Management app. \nFor example, start typing group into the search field on the taskbar and then click on the Group Policy Management app entry.\nCreate a GPO for 64-bit systems. \nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management window, right-click on the Group Policy Objects node and select the New option from the context menu. \nIn the New GPO window, enter a Name for the new 64-bit system GPO, and click on the OK button. \nIn this example, we used the name AgentP install policy for 64-bit but you can use any name you like.\nCreate a GPO for 32-bit systems. \nIn the left-hand pane of the Group Policy Management window, right-click on the Group Policy Objects node and select the New option from the context menu. \nIn the New GPO window, enter a Name for the new 32-bit system GPO, and click on the OK button. \nIn this example, we used the name AgentP install policy for 32-bit but you can use any name you like.\nResult: You created two GPOs, one for 64-bit Windows, and one for 32-bit Windows.\nCreate a software installation package for 64-bit systems and user assignment\nIn this section, you will create a software installation package that will be used to automatically deploy AgentP on devices with 64-bit versions of Windows and assign it to the users of these devices.\nNote: While many organizations choose user-based assignment, we recommend device-based assignment instead, because with user-based assignment, AgentP would need to be installed every time the user logs on.

You can also do these steps on a macOS system. However, to add a password to a private key on macOS, you will need to install and use third-party software such as OpenSSL.\nIf you want Portnox Cloud to generate a certificate for your printer through the self-onboarding portal, you must first create a user account that represents the printer in your integrated authentication repository or directly in Cloud. You must then be able to log in to the self-onboarding portal using that user account. After you complete the onboarding procedure, we recommend that you disable user logins for this account in your authentication repository or change the password if you use Cloud as your authentication repository. While we recommend creating individual accounts for each printer, you can also use a common user account for all printers or current user accounts.\nWe know that the following HP printer models are compatible with 802.1X Wi-Fi networks: HP LaserJet Pro 3001-3008, 4001-4004, MFP 3101-3108, 4101-4104. If your printer model is not one of these models, consult your documentation or contact your HP sales representative to find out if your HP printer is compatible with 802.1X. The HP Embedded Web Server currently does not support 802.1X for wired networks.\nUpdate the firmware on your printer to the latest version. We have encountered problems with 802.1X connectivity caused by outdated firmware.\nWe assume that you use the HP Smart software to manage and configure your printer. If not, please download and install HP Smart from the Microsoft Store and make sure you can connect to your printer using this software before you add the new certificate. While you can also configure the printer using the HP Embedded Web Server and a browser, this will become difficult after you install the new certificate, because HP printers use the same certificate for 802.1X authentication and for browser authentication, and browsers may be unable to recognize the self-signed certificates generated by Cloud.\nThe HP Embedded Web Server also supports authentication with credentials. However, it only supports LEAP and PEAP EAP methods, which are not secure. Therefore, we do not recommend and we do not provide instructions on setting up HP printers with credential-based 802.1X. If you must use credentials, Portnox Cloud supports PEAP, but only with the latest HP firmware installed.\nDownload the root CA certificate from Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud root CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nHP Smart asks you to upload a root CA certificate when configuring 802.1X connections. This is necessary so that the printer can verify the validity of Cloud RADIUS servers, which have certificates signed by this root CA certificate.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nThe right-hand pane shows the list of active servers.\nClick on any of the active RADIUS services to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link to download the root CA certificate. \nSave the file on your disk to use it later. The default name of the file is rootCertificate.cer.\nGenerate the user certificate for the printer\nIn this section, you will generate the certificate for the printer using the self-onboarding portal, and download it to your Windows computer.\nImportant: In the following steps, log in using the user account that you created for the printer, not your own user account.\nEnter the URL of the self-onboarding portal in your browser. \nIn Step 1, select the third option: Portnox account certificate management and click on the Next button. \nIn Step 2, you can select the Corporate email address option or the Corporate username and password option. Select the Corporate email address option if Portnox Cloud manages your user repository. Select the Corporate username and password option if you have integrated Cloud with an external repository. Proceed with the following steps depending on your choice. \nIf you have chosen Corporate email address: \nImportant: Only choose the Corporate email address option if Portnox Cloud manages your user repository. Cloud manages the user repository if it’s not integrated with any external repositories such as Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta Workforce Identity.\nIn the Email field, enter your corporate email address and click on the SIGN IN button. \nOpen your email client and find the email received from Portnox Cloud containing a one-time activation code. Copy this code to the clipboard. \nIn the self-onboarding portal, paste the code in the Activation code field and click on the CONFIRM button. \nIf you have chosen Corporate username and password: \nClick on the tile that represents the authentication repository you want to use to sign in. If you want to use credentials directly, enter your login and password and click on the SIGN IN button. \nComplete the steps needed to sign in. These steps depend on the chosen authentication repository. \nClick on the OBTAIN CERTIFICATE button to download the user certificate generated for your device. \nNote: If you want to replace a certificate you created earlier, for example, because the old one expires soon, click on the REISSUE CERTIFICATE button instead.\nResult: You downloaded the certificate and the corresponding private key.\nAdd a password to the printer certificate’s private key\nIn this section, you will temporarily import the downloaded certificate and then export it again, adding a password to the private key.\nBy default, private keys generated by Portnox Cloud and included with certificates have empty passwords. However, HP Smart does not accept an empty password for the private key, so you need to add a password to the private key to use the certificate with your HP printer.\nImport the downloaded certificate. \nDouble-click on the downloaded certificate file to temporarily install the certificate in your Windows certificate store. \nTo export the private key from the certificate, you must first install it, marking the private key as exportable. You cannot export the private key directly from the downloaded certificate without installing it.\nIn the first step of the Certificate Import Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn this step, you select the user certificate store by default. Note that you will delete the certificate after you add the password to the private key, so the selected certificate store is not important.\nIn the second step of the Certificate Import Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the third step of the Certificate Import Wizard, leave the Password field empty, activate the Mark this key as exportable checkbox, and then click on the Next button. \nYou must leave the password field empty because private keys included with Portnox Cloud certificates by default have empty passwords.\nIn the fourth step of the Certificate Import Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the fifth and final step of the Certificate Import Wizard, click on the Finish button. \nExport the certificate and the private key, adding a password to the private key. \nOpen the Windows Certificate Manager by typing manage user certificates in the Windows search bar and clicking on the Manage user certificates icon. \nIn the certmgr window, go to the folder and double-click on the certificate that you just imported. \nIn the Certificate window, go to the Details tab, and click on the Copy to File button. \nIn the first step of the Certificate Export Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the second step of the Certificate Export Wizard, select the Yes, export the private key option, and then click on the Next button. \nIn the third step of the Certificate Export Wizard, click on the Next button. \nIn the fourth step of the Certificate Export Wizard, activate the Password checkbox and enter a password in the Password and Confirm password fields. Then, click on the Next button. \nYou will use this password later when configuring the device.\nIn the fifth step of the Certificate Export Wizard, specify the file name to save the exported certificate and private key. Then, click on the Next button. \nYou can replace the previously imported file. The .pfx and .p12 extensions represent the same file format.\nIn the last step of the Certificate Export Wizard, click on the Finish button. \nDelete the temporarily imported certificate from your certificate store. \nSelect the certificate in your certificate store. \nPress the Delete key on your keyboard to delete the certificate and then click on the Yes button in the confirmation window. \nResult: You added a password to the private key of the downloaded certificate.\nConfigure the printer’s Wi-Fi connection\nIn this section, you will use HP Smart software to configure the printer for your Wi-Fi network managed by Portnox™ Cloud.\nTo be able to access the printer through HP Smart and configure the connection, you must first connect to the printer directly using Wi-Fi Direct, or connect the printer to a non-secured Wi-Fi or wired network. To connect to Wi-Fi Direct, go to Step one in the HP documentation for 802.1X connections. To connect to a non-secured Wi-Fi or wired network, follow the instructions in the printer manual or go to hpsmart.com/setup.\nNote: This example is based on a HP LaserJet Pro 3002dw printer, which we connected to a secured Wi-Fi network with SSID VORLON.\nIn the HP Smart user interface, click on the Printer Settings button. \nIn the HP Smart left-hand side menu, click on the Advanced Settings option to open the Embedded Web Server in HP Smart. \nIn the Embedded Web Server’s top menu, click on the Network option. \nEnter the PIN number for the printer and click on the Submit button. \nThe PIN number is printed on a label inside the printer, in the cartridge access area.\nOn the Network page, in the left-hand side menu, select . \nConfigure the wireless network settings: \nIn the field, enter the SSID of your network. \nIn the Network Settings section, click on the WPA option, in the WPA Version field, select WPA2, and then click on the WPA-Enterprise option. \nIn the Enable Protocols section, select the EAP-TLS option, and then click on the Configure button next to the Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate label. \nIn the Install a Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate section, click on the Choose File button, select the root CA certificate file that you downloaded earlier from Portnox Cloud, and then click on the Finish button. \nClick on the Configure button next to the Printer Certificate label. \nIn the Printer Certificate Options pane, select the Import a Certificate and Private Key option and click on the Next button. \nIn the Import a Certificate and Private Key pane, click on the Choose File button, choose the certificate that you obtained from the self-onboarding portal (the file with the added private key password), in the Password field, enter the password you chose for the private key, and then click on the Finish button. \nClick on the Apply button to apply your changes and connect to the secured Wi-Fi network. \nResult: The printer is connected to the Wi-Fi network managed by Portnox Cloud."

This option is used for onboarding when the user repository is managed by local Active Directory, local OpenLDAP, Entra ID, Google Workspace, or Okta Workforce Identity.\nUser accounts: The user will be able to onboard using their individual user account.\nComputer accounts: The user will be able to onboard using the account that represents the computer.\nEnable AgentP Multi-User (Windows OS only): AgentP checks if the user who is logged in to the computer is the same user that owns the active AgentP certificate. If not, AgentP will ask the current user to register using their credentials.\n: This setting is only for the multi-user mode. When this option is turned on, AgentP will use device certificates when no user is logged in. When this option is turned off, AgentP will use the last logged-in user’s certificate when no user is logged in. For more information, see this topic: AgentP and certificates.\nNote: The selected options means only that a specific onboarding mode is allowed for the group. To cause a specific instance of AgentP to onboard in a specific mode (if this mode is allowed using this setting), you must run AgentP installation with a specific switch or, if already onboarded, modify the Windows registry.

However, you can distribute custom profiles using Kandji, so you can create a custom profile and then use Kandji for management.\nThis topic shows you how to create a custom Apple profile for user-based authentication to connect to Portnox Cloud via Wi-Fi and Ethernet. We recommend that you use a free app called iMazing Profile Editor, but you can create a custom profile using a different tool or edit it manually in XML, if you prefer.\nIf your devices need only Wi-Fi connectivity, we recommend that you follow a simpler procedure in the following topic: Onboard macOS devices with certificates using Kandji and SCEP.\nImportant: This topic shows the configuration for macOS computers with macOS 12 (Monterey), but the Apple profile payloads Certificate, SCEP, and WiFi, which are used in this configuration, are compatible with the following Apple operating systems: iOS 4.0+, iPadOS 4.0+, macOS 10.7+, tvOS 9.0+, watchOS 3.2+. This means that you can use the same profiles to configure other Apple devices based on these operating systems, for example, iPhones.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the later step in which you get the Cloud SCEP URL and password.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nImportant: This topic shows the configuration for macOS computers with macOS 12 (Monterey), but the Apple profile payloads Certificate, SCEP, and WiFi, which are used in this configuration, are compatible with the following Apple operating systems: iOS 4.0+, iPadOS 4.0+, macOS 10.7+, tvOS 9.0+, watchOS 3.2+.

This is the name used in the next part of this guide. \nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Kandji team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Kandji to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Kandji, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nThe tenant CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, tenantCertificate.cer.\nCreate the custom profile\nIn this section, you will use the iMazing Profile Editor to create an Apple profile for use in Kandji, which contains the following payloads: the root CA certificate, the tenant CA certificate, the SCEP configuration, the Wi-Fi configuration, and the Global Ethernet configuration.\nNote: This guide shows the configuration on a macOS version of the iMazing Profile Editor, but you can also prepare the profile file using a Windows version of this application.\nInstall the iMazing Profile Editor and open it from the Launcher. \nTo install iMazing Profile Editor, follow the links from the iMazing website and the standard installation procedure in the operating system.\nNote: By default, when you run iMazing Profile Editor, it opens a new profile window and the General section. If not, select from the top menu to open a new profile window.\nIn the right-hand side pane, in the Name section, enter a name for this profile. \nWe used the name Vorlon SCEP but you can use any name you like.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the Root Certificate icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the file selector, locate and click on the root CA certificate file, downloaded as described in the previous section, and then click on the Open button. \nCopy the value of the Payload UUID field and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this root CA certificate in the Wi-Fi and Ethernet payloads later, so that the device can confirm the identity of the RADIUS server.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says root CA UUID.\nIn the top-right corner of the right-hand side pane, click on the + button to add another root certificate payload. \nIn the file selector, locate and click on the tenant CA certificate file, downloaded and converted as described in the previous sections, and then click on the Open button. \nCopy the value of the Payload UUID field and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this tenant CA certificate in the Wi-Fi and Ethernet payloads later, so that the device can confirm the SCEP certificate validity.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says tenant CA UUID.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the SCEP icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the SCEP pane on the right-hand side, configure the following properties: \nIn the URL section, enter the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Subject section, enter: CN={$EMAIL}. \nNote:\nThe $EMAIL format is a Kandji global variable. This tag is processed by Kandji and replaced by the email of the user. The full list of Kandji global variables is available in the Kandji documentation. Portnox Cloud then uses the email from the certificate fields to create or align with an account in Cloud.\nAt this time, Portnox Cloud does not support device-based authentication for Kandji. If you try to use Kandji variables related to device identifiers, Cloud will not be able to align this information with information from the authentication repository, and it will create new Portnox accounts for devices instead of aligning them with accounts from the authentication repository.\nIn the NT Principal Name section, enter: {$EMAIL}. \nIn the Challenge section, enter the SCEP password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nImportant: Addigy does not support special characters in passwords.\nIn the Key Size section, select the key size that you want to use. \nIn this example, we used the value 2048 but you can use 1024. Note that while higher values provide more security, they may cause certificate fragmentation problems in some network topologies. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Key Usage section, select the Both signing and encryption option. \nCopy the value in the Payload UUID and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this SCEP certificate in the Wi-Fi payload later, so that the device can confirm the SCEP certificate validity.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says SCEP UUID.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the Wi-Fi icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the Wi-Fi pane on the right-hand side, configure the following properties: \nIn the Service Set Identifier (SSID) section, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nIn the Accept EAP Types section, click on the + button, click on the added entry, and select TLS. \nIn the Password field, enter any value (this value is ignored). \nThis is necessary due to a bug in the iMazing Profile Editor. When you authenticate using TLS, the password is not used, but iMazing Profile Editor requires that you enter a password anyway.\nNote: The Wi-Fi profile has two Password sections. The one that requires a value is directly under the Accept EAP Types section.\nIn the Certificate Anchor UUID section, click on the + button twice, and in the new entry fields, paste the UUIDs that you copied earlier as root CA UUID and tenant CA UUID. \nYou need a reference to the root CA certificate so that the device can confirm that the Portnox RADIUS server is authentic, and you need a reference to the tenant CA certificate so that the device can confirm the validity of the SCEP certificate for the current user or device.\nIn the Trusted Server Certificate Names section, click on the + button and in the new entry field, type clear-rad.portnox.com. \nIn the Certificate UUID section, paste the UUID that you copied earlier as SCEP UUID. \nActivate the Disable MAC address randomization during association checkbox. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the 802.1X Ethernet: Global icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nNote: Depending on your hardware configurations, you can choose a different 802.1X Ethernet payload, for example, First Active Ethernet.

  "text": "Onboard macOS devices with certificates using Addigy and SCEP\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy Portnox™ Cloud SCEP certificates via Addigy, SCEP, and iMazing Profile Editor to manage macOS devices.\nAddigy lets you create simple profiles using the cloud user interface but does not let you create profiles with many payloads, which you need to connect to Portnox Cloud using SCEP. However, you can distribute custom profiles using Addigy, so you can create a custom profile and then use Addigy for management.\nThis topic shows you how to create a custom Apple profile for user-based authentication to connect to Portnox Cloud via Wi-Fi and Ethernet. We recommend that you use a free app called iMazing Profile Editor, but you can create a custom profile using a different tool or edit it manually in XML, if you prefer.\nImportant: This topic shows the configuration for macOS computers with macOS 12 (Monterey), but the Apple profile payloads Certificate, SCEP, and WiFi, which are used in this configuration, are compatible with the following Apple operating systems: iOS 4.0+, iPadOS 4.0+, macOS 10.7+, tvOS 9.0+, watchOS 3.2+. This means that you can use the same profiles to configure other Apple devices based on these operating systems, for example, iPhones.\nTurn on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services\nIn this section, you will configure Portnox™ Cloud to provide SCEP services to your devices.\nIf you have previously turned on the Portnox Cloud SCEP services, skip to the later step in which you get the Cloud SCEP URL and password.\nPortnox Cloud SCEP services let devices contact the Cloud SCEP server and get a unique certificate for the device or for the specific user of the device.\nImportant: This topic shows the configuration for macOS computers with macOS 12 (Monterey), but the Apple profile payloads Certificate, SCEP, and WiFi, which are used in this configuration, are compatible with the following Apple operating systems: iOS 4.0+, iPadOS 4.0+, macOS 10.7+, tvOS 9.0+, watchOS 3.2+. This means that you can use the same profiles to configure other Apple devices based on these operating systems, for example, iPhones.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nEnable integration with SCEP services. \nClick on the Edit link. \nActivate the Enable integration checkbox. \nClick on the Save button. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the SCEP URL field to copy the SCEP URL, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nClick on the ⧉ icon next to the Password field to copy the SCEP password, and paste it in a text file for later use. \nDownload the root CA certificate\nIn this section, you will download the root CA certificate from Portnox™ Cloud, which is needed to create a profile.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nClick on any of the RADIUS servers listed in the right-hand pane to show its configuration. \nClick on the Download root certificate link. \nResult: The root CA certificate file is in the Downloads folder on the local disk.\nDownload the tenant CA certificate\nIn this section, you will download the Portnox™ Cloud tenant CA certificate from the Cloud portal.\nYou need the tenant CA certificate from Portnox Cloud so that your managed devices can verify the validity of individual SCEP certificates, which are signed using the tenant CA certificate.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Trusted Root Certificates section, click on the Download CER link, then save the downloaded file. \nThe default name of the file is Your_tenant_name - Portnox CLEAR.cer, for example, Vorlon - Portnox CLEAR.cer.\nOptional: Rename the downloaded file to tenantCertificate.cer. This is the name used in the next part of this guide. \nOptional: Hand over information from the Portnox Cloud team to the Addigy team\nIn this section, you will learn what information was collected in previous steps from Portnox Cloud, which is needed to configure Addigy to work with Portnox Cloud.\nIf different people are responsible for managing Portnox Cloud and Addigy, here is the information you need to hand over:\nThe URL of the Portnox Cloud SCEP server. For example, https://scep.portnox.com/b2973887-1274-45d4-91d0-4a342a861c76.\nThe password for the SCEP server.\nThe root CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, rootCertificate.cer.\nThe tenant CA certificate file in the X.509 format. For example, tenantCertificate.cer.\nCreate the custom profile\nIn this section, you will use the iMazing Profile Editor to create an Apple profile for use in Addigy, which contains the following payloads: the root CA certificate, the tenant CA certificate, the SCEP configuration for user-based authentication, the Wi-Fi configuration, and the Global Ethernet configuration.\nNote: This guide shows the configuration on a macOS version of the iMazing Profile Editor, but you can also prepare the profile file using a Windows version of this application.\nInstall the iMazing Profile Editor and open it from the Launcher. \nTo install iMazing Profile Editor, follow the links from the iMazing website and the standard installation procedure in the operating system.\nNote: By default, when you run iMazing Profile Editor, it opens a new profile window and the General section. If not, select from the top menu to open a new profile window.\nIn the right-hand side pane, in the Name section, enter a name for this profile. \nWe used the name Vorlon SCEP but you can use any name you like.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the Root Certificate icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the file selector, locate and click on the root CA certificate file, downloaded as described in the previous section, and then click on the Open button. \nCopy the value of the Payload UUID field and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this root CA certificate in the Wi-Fi and Ethernet payloads later, so that the device can confirm the identity of the RADIUS server.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says root CA UUID.\nIn the top-right corner of the right-hand side pane, click on the + button to add another root certificate payload. \nIn the file selector, locate and click on the tenant CA certificate file, downloaded and converted as described in the previous sections, and then click on the Open button. \nCopy the value of the Payload UUID field and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this tenant CA certificate in the Wi-Fi and Ethernet payloads later, so that the device can confirm the SCEP certificate validity.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says tenant CA UUID.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the SCEP icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the SCEP pane on the right-hand side, configure the following properties: \nIn the URL section, enter the SCEP URL that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nIn the Subject section, enter: CN={{.Fact \"current_user\"}}. \nNote:\nThe .Fact format is specific to Addigy. This tag is processed by Addigy and replaced by the name of the currently logged-in user. The full list of Addigy facts is available in the Addigy documentation. Portnox Cloud then uses the user name from the certificate fields to create or align with an account in Cloud.\nAt this time, Portnox Cloud does not support device-based authentication for Addigy. If you try to use Addigy facts related to device identifiers, Cloud will not be able to align this information with information from the authentication repository, and it will create new Portnox accounts for devices instead of aligning them with accounts from the authentication repository.\nIn the NT Principal Name section, enter: {{.Fact \"current_user\"}}. \nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field, which is identified as the NT Principal Name field in Addigy. You can use a different SAN field, but it is not recommended. For more information, see the following topic: Certificate identity information.\nIn the Challenge section, enter the SCEP password that you copied earlier from Portnox Cloud. \nImportant: Addigy does not support special characters in passwords.\nIn the Key Size section, select the key size that you want to use. \nIn this example, we used the value 2048 but you can use 1024. Note that while higher values provide more security, they may cause certificate fragmentation problems in some network topologies. If such problems occur, see the following topic: Certificate fragmentation issues.\nIn the Key Usage section, select the Both signing and encryption option. \nCopy the value in the Payload UUID and save it for later use. \nYou will need to add a reference to this SCEP certificate in the Wi-Fi payload later, so that the device can confirm the SCEP certificate validity.\nNote: Make a note next to this value that says SCEP UUID.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the Wi-Fi icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nIn the Wi-Fi pane on the right-hand side, configure the following properties: \nIn the Service Set Identifier (SSID) section, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network. \nIn the Accept EAP Types section, click on the + button, click on the added entry, and select TLS. \nIn the Password field, enter any value (this value is ignored). \nThis is necessary due to a bug in the iMazing Profile Editor. When you authenticate using TLS, the password is not used, but iMazing Profile Editor requires that you enter a password anyway.\nNote: The Wi-Fi profile has two Password sections. The one that requires a value is directly under the Accept EAP Types section.\nIn the Certificate Anchor UUID section, click on the + button twice, and in the new entry fields, paste the UUIDs that you copied earlier as root CA UUID and tenant CA UUID. \nYou need a reference to the root CA certificate so that the device can confirm that the Portnox RADIUS server is authentic, and you need a reference to the tenant CA certificate so that the device can confirm the validity of the SCEP certificate for the current user or device.\nIn the Trusted Server Certificate Names section, click on the + button and in the new entry field, type clear-rad.portnox.com. \nIn the Certificate UUID section, paste the UUID that you copied earlier as SCEP UUID. \nActivate the Disable MAC address randomization during association checkbox. \nImportant: If you do not turn off MAC address randomization, and the supplicant certificates are not issued by Portnox SCEP, and the certificate’s SAN field does not include a Jamf or Intune device ID, Portnox Cloud assigns a new license to the device each time it connects with a different MAC address. This can significantly increase your licensing costs. Even if you use Portnox SCEP and this issue does not apply, we still recommend turning MAC address randomization off for safety.\nOn the left-hand side of the profile window, scroll down to the 802.1X Ethernet: Global icon, click on it, and in the right-hand side pane click on the Add Configuration Payload button. \nNote: Depending on your hardware configurations, you can choose a different 802.1X Ethernet payload, for example, First Active Ethernet. The setup procedure is almost the same for all 802.1X payloads.\nIn the 802.1X Ethernet: Global pane on the right-hand side, configure the following properties: \nIn the Accept EAP Types section, click on the + button, click on the added entry, and select TLS. \nIn the Password field, enter any value (this value is ignored). \nThis is necessary due to a bug in the iMazing Profile Editor. When you authenticate using TLS, the password is not used, but iMazing Profile Editor requires that you enter a password anyway.\nIn the Certificate Anchor UUID section, click on the + button twice, and in the new entry fields, paste the UUIDs that you copied earlier as root CA UUID and tenant CA UUID. \nYou need a reference to the root CA certificate so that the device can confirm that the Portnox RADIUS server is authentic, and you need a reference to the tenant CA certificate so that the device can confirm the validity of the SCEP certificate for the current user or device.\nIn the Trusted Server Certificate Names section, click on the + button and in the new entry field, type clear-rad.portnox.com. \nIn the Interface section, select the Any Ethernet option. \nIn the top menu of iMazing Profile Editor, select , and select a location to save the profile. \nResult: The custom profile file (.mobileconfig) is saved on the disk and ready for use in Addigy.\nAdd the custom profile to Addigy\nIn this section, you will upload the custom profile file to Addigy and assign it to an existing policy, so that Addigy can distribute it to managed devices.\nLog in to your Addigy account by visiting app.addigy.com. \nIn the main Addigy menu on the left-hand side, click on the Catalog option, and then in the right-hand side pane, click on the MDM Profiles heading. \nClick on the New button on the right-hand side above the list of profiles. \nClick on the Custom Profile button in the top-right corner of the right-hand side pane. \nIn the Custom Profile pane, leave the default values or modify them as needed, and click on the Select .mobileconfig file button. Then, select the custom profile file that you prepared earlier. \nScroll down the pane that contains profile details, and in the bottom-right corner, click on the Create button. \nIn the list of profiles, click on the … menu icon next to the newly created profile name, and select the Assignments option. \nIn the Item Policies window, select the policies that you want to assign this profile to, and then click on the Save button. \nNote: If you configured an Ethernet payload for your profile, and distributed this profile to your managed devices, the first time that the user of the managed device connects to the Ethernet, they may be asked to select the connection profile (to choose between Wi-Fi and 802.1X Global Ethernet) and the certificate to use (to choose between the Addigy certificate and their SCEP certificate). This is a standard behavior for macOS and it cannot be modified by the profile."

If that fails, please create a support ticket with Splunk to guide you on the correct collector URL for your tenant/infrastructure.\nSplunk Enterprise (on-premises):\nhttps://your_server:8088/services/collector/event\nwhere your_server is your on-premises server.\nNote: The standard port is 8088 but you can configure a different port in Splunk: .\nNote: By default, Splunk Enterprise uses its own self-signed certificates, which don’t work with Portnox Cloud. To set up a valid certificate in Splunk, consult Splunk documentation. Alternatively, if you’re just testing the integration in a lab environment, you can temporarily turn off SSL support () and use http:// in the URL.\nNote: If you need to configure the firewall to restrict this access to specific IPs, use the following IP addresses: 23.97.155.157, 52.168.164.222, 20.72.156.111, and 51.124.144.69.\nIn the Authentication token field, paste the token that you copied earlier when setting up the Splunk collector. \nIn the Data format field, select the JSON option. \nClick on the Save button to add the integration. \nOptional: Test the configuration by clicking on the Test button. \nOptional: To configure the types of alerts sent to your SIEM solution, see the following topic: Portnox Cloud alerts. \nYou can also send all of the Portnox Cloud activity log (activities performed by administrators in Portnox Cloud) to your SIEM solution. To do this, go to , activate the Activity log switch, and click on the Save button.\nResult: Splunk is receiving alerts from Portnox Cloud.\nYou can confirm the integration, for example, by running a query source=\"http:collector_name\" where collector_name is the name that you used for the HTTP Event Collector."

  "text": "Configure RADIUS forwarding rules\nIn this topic, you will learn how to configure forwarding rules for Cloud RADIUS servers.\nBefore you begin, you must have an active Cloud RADIUS server in Portnox Cloud. To create a Cloud RADIUS server, read the following topic: Create Cloud RADIUS servers.\nRADIUS forwarding rules let you use the Cloud RADIUS servers as your main servers, but forward selected RADIUS requests to another server. This may be useful, for example, if you want selected networks or selected domains to be handled by an independent local RADIUS server or another Cloud RADIUS server. One of the main applications of this functionality is eduroam\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand side menu, click on the option. \nClick on the Add custom forwarding rule to add a forwarding rule. \nEach forwarding rule has two conditions (Domain name and Network name) and an action (RADIUS Server Provider). Conditions are evaluated as a logical OR – if just one of them is true, the server takes the action. The action can be either to process the request using the cloud RADIUS server that received the request originally, or to forward the request to another external RADIUS server.\nCloud RADIUS servers process the rules each time that they receive a RADIUS request from a NAS. If the request matches the first rule, Portnox Cloud follows the action that is set for that rule. If not, the process continues with the next rule. If no rule matches, the request is processed by the Cloud RADIUS server that received the request.\nSelect the condition in the Domain name field: \nIf you want this rule to apply to all domain names, select Any domain name.\nIf you want this rule to apply to specific domains only, select Custom domain name list.\nClick on the Add domain name link below. In the field that appears, enter a domain name. Click on the Add button below the field.\nIf you want this rule to apply to more domains, repeat this process by clicking on Add domain name again. If you made a mistake, click on the Remove link to the right of the domain name to remove the domain name.\nNote: The forwarding rules search for domain names in RADIUS User-Name attributes of the requests sent by the NAS to the Cloud RADIUS server.\nSelect the condition in the Network name field: \nIf you want this rule to apply to all network names, select Any network name.\nIf you want this rule to apply to specific networks names only, select Custom network name list.\nClick on the Add network name link below. In the field that appears, enter a network name. Click on the Add button below the field.\nIf you want this rule to apply to more networks, repeat this process by clicking on Add network name again. If you made a mistake, click on the Remove link to the right of the network name to remove the network name.\nNote: The forwarding rules search for network names in the Called-Station-Id attributes of the request sent by the NAS to the Cloud RADIUS server. Network names can be, for example, SSIDs.\nSelect the action in the RADIUS Server Provider field: \nIf you want this rule to keep the request for processing in the Cloud RADIUS server that originally received the request, select This Portnox Cloud tenant will service these requests.\nIf you want this rule to forward the request to another RADIUS server, select Forward RADIUS authentication requests to another Portnox Cloud tenant or to an external RADIUS server.\nClick on the Add another RADIUS server button to add a server definition.\nEnter relevant parameters for the RADIUS server to forward the requests to: Target Host, Target Authentication Port, Target Accounting Port, and the Shared Secret.\nNote: Each rule can define a different external RADIUS server, but all these servers must be available on a public interface. You cannot forward the request to one of the two Cloud RADIUS servers or you risk creating an endless loop if the same server originally receives the request.\nAdd more servers if needed (up to three).\nNote: You can have up to three defined target servers. Authentication requests are forwarded to the first server in priority order. If there is no response for 30 seconds from a server, that server is marked as dead​, and then the next server is used for subsequent authentication attempts​. If all servers are marked as dead, then the last server will be used. A server is marked live again after 2 minutes automatically. There are no retries unless configured on the NAS device.\nOptional: Configure settings in the Additional settings section: \nActivate the Add Stripped-User-Name attribute checkbox, if you want the Cloud RADIUS servers to add the Stripped-User-Name attribute to the forwarded request. This attribute contains the user identifier without delimiters and domain names, and may be required by some RADIUS servers.\nActivate the Assign to a specific VLAN checkbox, if you want the Cloud RADIUS servers to forward the request and suggest a specific vlan using the Tunnel-Private-Group-ID attribute. Enter the VLAN name in the VLAN field.\nClick on the Save button to save your changes or click on the Cancel button to abandon all changes. \nAfter you click on one of the buttons, Portnox Cloud will exit the edit mode.\nTo add more rules, repeat the above process by clicking on the Add custom forwarding rule link. \nTo edit an existing rule, click on the Edit link next to the rule. \nThe editing process is identical to creating a new rule.\nTo remove an existing rule, click on the Remove link next to the rule."

  "text": "AgentP and certificates\nIn this topic, you will learn what certificates AgentP installs on Windows computers in its different operating modes.\nWhat is the computer certificate store and the user certificate store?\nThere are two places where a Windows system stores certificates: the computer certificate store (managed using the Manage computer certificates control panel) and the user certificate store (managed using the Manage user certificates control panel). The computer certificate store is accessible as soon as the operating system is running, even when there is no logged-in user. The user certificate store is accessible for the specific logged-in user. For example, if the user kosh is logged in, neither this user nor the operating system can access the certificates in the user certificate store that belongs to the user ulkesh, or the other way around.\nThis gives two ways of authenticating the endpoint on a network. A certificate from the computer store guarantees that this is a specific device (for example, a company device). A certificate from the user store guarantees that a specific user is logged on to this device and lets you adjust network access depending on the privileges of that user.\nWhat are computer certificates and user certificates?\nIn addition to the two different certificate stores, there are also two common names used to describe the types of certificates: user certificates and computer certificates (or device certificates). These names apply not to the store where the certificate is located, but rather to the information that is in the certificate.\nFor example, a user certificate may have the user’s email address in the Subject field, or in one of the SAN (Subject Alternative Name) fields, such as the email field. This way, the application or system that checks this certificate can verify that this is a certificate that was issued for this specific user.\nOn the other hand, a computer/device certificate may have the device ID or another unique identifier of the device in the Subject field or one of the SAN fields, such as the Distinguished Name. This way, the application or system that checks this certificate can verify that this certificate was issued for the specific device, and not an individual user.\nNote: While the computer certificate store is primarily for computer certificates, and the user certificate store is for user certificates, there is no limitation as to the types of certificates in each store. You can have user certificates in the computer store and computer certificates in the user store.\nHow does AgentP use computer and user certificates?\nOn Windows, AgentP can run in one of three operating modes:\nSingle-user mode: Network access will be based on user certificates only (from the user store and the computer store) because no computer certificates are available. This means that when the user logs out, the computer maintains access to the network with the credentials of the last user that was logged in (using the certificate of that user).\nNote: This is the default mode if Portnox Cloud uses a repository that doesn’t support computer accounts (such as Google Workspace and Okta Workforce Identity), or if your tenant was created before March 18, 2024 (see below) or you turned off the Install computer certificate option.\nExample: The tenant Vorlon is integrated with Google Workspace.\nThe user Kosh (kosh@vorlon.com) logs in to the computer (for the first time).\nKosh has no access to the secure network, so he connects to a guest SSID.\nKosh onboards AgentP using their Google Workspace credentials.\nAgentP installs Kosh’s user certificate.\nThe computer now has secure network access with Kosh’s privileges.\nKosh logs out of the computer. The computer, in the background, still has secure network access with Kosh’s privileges (using his user certificate from the computer store).\nThe user Ulkesh (ulkesh@vorlon.com) logs in to the same computer (for the first time). \nUlkesh has no access to the secure network, so he connects to a guest SSID.\nUlkesh onboards AgentP using their Google Workspace credentials.\nAgentP installs Ulkesh’s user certificate.\nThe computer now has secure network access with Ulkesh’s privileges.\nUlkesh logs out of the computer. The computer still has network access in the background with Ulkesh’s privileges (using his user certificate from the computer store).\nMulti-user mode: Network access will be based on the user certificate of the logged-in user (from the user store), and when no user is logged in, on the computer certificate (from the computer store).\nMulti-user mode only applies when AgentP is installed in unattended (auto-enroll) scenarios. Enabling multi-user does not alter certificate distribution or impact devices already enrolled in single-user mode. Existing single-user devices continue to function as before, while new or reactivated devices can take advantage of multi-user behavior.\nNote: This is the default mode if Portnox Cloud uses a repository that integrates with the Windows operating system (Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory), and the tenant was created after March 18, 2024 or you turned on the Install computer certificate option (see below).\nExample: The tenant Vorlon is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.\nThe user Kosh (kosh@vorlon.com) logs in to the computer with their Entra ID credentials. \nAgentP uses the Kosh’s user certificate from the user store to authorize with the network.\nThe computer now has secure network access with Kosh’s privileges.\nKosh logs out of the computer. The computer still has network access in the background with privileges based on the computer certificate.\nThe user Ulkesh (ulkesh@vorlon.com) logs in to the same computer with their Entra ID credentials. \nAgentP uses the Ulkesh’s user certificate from the user store to authorize with the network.\nThe computer now has secure network access with Ulkesh’s privileges.\nUlkesh logs out of the computer. The computer still has network access in the background with privileges based on the computer certificate installed earlier.\nImportant:\nDue to the way Windows handles certificates in the user store and the computer store, a Windows device cannot use the device certificate from the computer store when a user is logged in. This means that if a new user logs in to the device for the first time ever and wants to onboard with AgentP, the device has no certificate to authorize this new user with the network.\nThere are two workarounds to this problem:\nOption 1: Quarantine VLAN\nCreate a quarantine VLAN on the NAS device and configure Portnox Cloud so that users who fail network authentication still have access to the Internet, or only to specific FQDNs, as listed here: How to set up the firewall for AgentP to connect to Cloud.\nAsk the new user to try to connect to the corporate network on the device. The device will be placed in this quarantine VLAN, but AgentP will have access to the Internet or to Portnox Cloud servers only, so it will be able to onboard the new user.\nAfter AgentP is onboarded, ask the new user to disconnect from the corporate network and connect again. The device now has the user certificate, so it will authenticate with the network and will no longer be placed in the quarantine VLAN.\nOption 2: Guest network\nAsk the new user to connect to the company guest network. AgentP will have access to the Internet, so it will be able to onboard the new user.\nAfter AgentP is onboarded, ask the new user to disconnect from the guest network and connect to the corporate network. The device now has the user certificate, so it will authenticate with the network.\nKiosk mode: Network access will be based only on the certificate from the computer store. Certificates in the user stores will be ignored.\nNote: This mode must be activated manually. It is only available if Portnox Cloud uses a repository that supports computer accounts (Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory)\nExample: The tenant Vorlon is integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.\nThe computer Sigma957 is a kiosk computer. \nThe administrator logs in to the computer with the administrator account, installs AgentP, and onboards it using their own Entra ID credentials.\nAgentP installs the administrator’s user certificate in the user store and the computer’s (sigma957.vorlon.com) certificate in the computer store.\nThe administrator switches AgentP to kiosk mode and logs out of the computer. Since the administrator is logged out, their user certificate is no longer accessible.\nThe administrator logs in the local kiosk account.\nSigma937 now has network access with privileges based on the computer certificate installed earlier.\nWhat certificates does AgentP install?\nIndependent on which mode you choose, AgentP prepares the computer for all operating modes and installs certificates in the computer store and the user store:\nIf you created your tenant on March 18, 2024 or later or you turned on the Install computer certificate option, and if your tenant is integrated with Active Directory or Entra ID, AgentP installs the following certificates:\nA user certificate in the user certificate store. If AgentP is running in the single-user mode, it installs this certificate only once, during enrollment. If AgentP is running in the multi-user mode, it installs the current user’s certificate in the user store every time a new user logs in. If AgentP is running in the kiosk mode, it installs this certificate during enrollment but never uses it.\nA computer certificate in the computer certificate store. This certificate can be used in multi-user mode by the network adapter when no user is logged in to maintain Internet access so that AgentP can connect to the Portnox Cloud when another user logs in and obtain information necessary to onboard that user.\nIf you created your tenant on March 17, 2024 or earlier, if you turned off the or you turned on the Install computer certificate option, or if your tenant is integrated with non-Microsoft authentication repositories, AgentP installs the following certificates:\nA user certificate in the user certificate store. If AgentP is running in the single-user mode, it installs this certificate only once, during enrollment. If AgentP is running in the multi-user mode, it installs the current user’s certificate in the user store every time a new user logs in. If AgentP is running in the kiosk mode, it installs this certificate during enrollment but never uses it.\nThe currently logged-in user’s certificate in the computer certificate store. This certificate can be used in multi-user mode by the network adapter when no user is logged in to maintain Internet access so that AgentP can connect to the Portnox Cloud when another user logs in and obtain information necessary to onboard that user.\nWhat is the 802.1X authentication mode setting?\nWhen you configure a group in Portnox Cloud, you come across a setting called 802.1X authentication mode :\nThese options let you decide how AgentP configures the network adapter when connecting to the secure network:\nComputer authentication only: AgentP configures the network adapter to always use the certificate from the computer store. This means that the network adapter will use the same certificate when there is no logged-in user, and when a user is logged in, independent of what user is logged in.\nUser authentication only: AgentP configures the network adapter to use the certificate from the user store only. This means that when there is no logged-in user, the computer will not be able to access the networks protected by Portnox Cloud. When a user is logged in, the network adapter will use the certificate of the logged-in user. This setting should only be used for dedicated company devices used by one person only.\nUser or computer authentication (Recommended): AgentP configures the network adapter to use the certificate from the computer store when there is no logged-in user, and a certificate from the user store when a user is logged in. You can also use this setting for personal devices and for kiosk devices. This lets you switch between different modes of operation without the need to reconfigure Portnox Cloud.\nNote: AgentP installs the certificates described above independent on this setting. Even if you, for example, select Computer authentication only, AgentP will still install a user certificate in the user certificate store when you enroll. It will simply not use that certificate when configuring the network adapter."

This tag is processed by Kandji and replaced by the email of the user. The full list of Kandji global variables is available in the Kandji documentation. Portnox Cloud then uses the email from the certificate fields to create or align with an account in Cloud.\nAt this time, Portnox Cloud does not support device-based authentication for Kandji. If you try to use Kandji variables related to device identifiers, Cloud will not be able to align this information with information from the authentication repository, and it will create new Portnox accounts for devices instead of aligning them with accounts from the authentication repository.\nActivate the Specify Subject Alternative Names (SAN) checkbox, in the SAN type field, select the NT Principal Name option, and in the value field, type $EMAIL. \nNote: By default, Portnox Cloud checks for user identity information in the SAN UPN field (NT Principal Name in macOS).

  "text": "Deploy the local RADIUS server container in Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nIn this topic, you will learn how to deploy the Portnox™ Cloud local RADIUS server container in Amazon Web Services (AWS) using AWS Fargate.\nTo deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container in AWS Container Instances, you must first configure the settings for the local RADIUS server container and generate environment variables. To do it, go to the following topic: Run the local RADIUS server in a container.\nRead the following important information before you begin:\nAWS Fargate is one of the options to deploy the local RADIUS server container in AWS. Other options include using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or EC2 instances. If you choose a different option, please follow the relevant AWS documentation for your chosen method.\nIn order for the local RADIUS server container in AWS to be able to communicate with your NAS devices in your local network, you must create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS and connect it to your local network. AWS offers many ways of achieving this. This topic is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find useful information in the following AWS documentation topic: Connect your VPC to remote networks using AWS Virtual Private Network.\nYou cannot place NAS devices behind a NAT because the local RADIUS server uses the source IP address of the connection, and with a NAT in place, that address would be the same for several NAS devices.\nWhen you’re using stateless containers and you want to update to a newer version of the Docker image, you need to delete the container and recreate it from scratch with the same parameters.\nCreate a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nIn this section, you will create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a private subnet for local RADIUS server containers.\nNote: You can skip this section if you already have a Virtual Private Cloud with a subnet that you want to dedicate to your local RADIUS server containers and relevant configuration. You can also add a new subnet to an existing VPC manually.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the VPC dashboard pane, click on the Create VPC button to begin creating the VPC. \nIn the VPC settings section, select the VPC and more option. \nIn the Name tag auto-generation section, activate the Auto-generate checkbox and enter a prefix in the text field below. \nIn this example, we used the prefix portnox, but you can use any prefix you like.\nIn the IPv4 CIDR block field, enter the IPv4 CIDR block for your private network. \nIn this example, we used the 10.1.0.0/16 private network block but you can use any block you like. The default block offered by AWS is 10.0.0.0/16.\nIn the Number of Availability Zones (AZs) field, select 1. \nIn the Number of public subnets field, select 1 and in the Number of private subnets field, select 1. \nNote: You need the public subnet in AWS to connect the local RADIUS server to the internet.\nIn the NAT gateways field, select the In 1 AZoption. \nIn the VPC endpoints field, select the None option. \nActivate the checkboxes: Enable DNS hostnames and Enable DNS resolution. \nClick on the Create VPC button below to create the VPC. \nCreate a task definition and a cluster\nIn this section, you will deploy the local RADIUS server Docker container to the Virtual Private Cloud created in the previous step by creating a task definition and a cluster.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click on the Task definitions option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create new task definition button. \nIn the Create new task definition pane, in the Task definition family field, enter a name for your task definition. \nIn this example, we used the task name RADIUS but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Infrastructure requirements section, in the Launch type field, select the AWS Fargate option and in the Operating system/Architecture field, select the Linux/X86_64 option. \nIn the section, in the Name field, enter a name for the container, and in the Image URI field, enter portnox/portnox-radius:latest. \nIn this example, we used the container name radius but you can use any name you like.\nIn the section, click on the Add environment variable button three times to add three environment variables. Then, copy and paste the values of the three environment variables that you saved earlier (or copy them directly from Portnox Cloud) into three Key and Value pairs. \nOptional: If you want to store the RADIUS_GATEWAY_TOKEN value safely as a secret, you can use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: \nIn another browser tab, in the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand menu of the Systems Manager pane, select the option. \nClick on the Create parameter button. \nIn the Create parameter pane, in the Name field, enter a name for your parameter, for example radius_gateway_token. \nIn the Value field, paste the value of the token copied from Portnox Cloud. \nClick on the Create parameter button below. \nGo back to the task definition tab, and in the relevant environment variable, as the value enter ssm:/radius_gateway_token. \nScroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Create button. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click on the Clusters option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create cluster option. \nIn the Cluster name field, enter a name for your cluster, and in the Infrastructure section, select the AWS Fargate option. Then, click on the Create button below. \nIn this example, we used the cluster Portnox but you can use any name you like.\nAfter your cluster has been created successfully, in the left-hand side menu of the Amazon Elastic Container Service pane, click again on the Task definitions option. \nIn the Task definitions pane, click on the name of the task definition you created earlier, and then click on the latest revision in the list of revisions. \nClick on the Deploy button in the top-right corner, and select the Run task option. \nIn the Create pane, in the Existing cluster field, select the cluster that you just created. \nScroll down to the Networking section and click on the heading to show the section. In the VPC field, select the virtual private cloud that you created earlier, in the Subnets field, select the subnets that you created together with the VPC, and in the Public IP section, turn the switch off. \nScroll all the way down and click on the Create button. \nAfter the deployment is complete, note down the Private IP address of the server. \nResult: Your local RADIUS server is active.\nYou can check its status in Portnox Cloud, in the section.\nCreate a private hosted DNS zone\nIn this section, you will create a private hosted DNS zone for your Virtual Private Cloud, which lets you configure your NAS devices to access the local RADIUS server using a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of its IP address.\nEvery time that you stop and restart your local RADIUS server container in AWS, it may be assigned a different IP address on the subnet, which means you would have to reconfigure your NAS devices after every restart. Unfortunately, at this time, AWS does not offer any method to maintain a fixed IP address on its virtual private cloud.\nTo overcome this problem, you can configure a private hosted DNS zone in AWS, assign a private FQDN to the local RADIUS server, and configure the NAS devices to access this server using this FQDN. This way, if you need to restart the container and get a different IP address, you can just change the IP address in the zone definition instead of having to reconfigure every NAS device.\nIn the Services menu of the AWS portal, select the option. \nIn the left-hand side menu of the Route 53 pane, click on the Hosted zones option. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the Create hosted zone button. \nIn the Create hosted zone pane, in the Domain name, enter the local domain name that you want to use and in the Type section, click on the Private hosted zone option. \nIn this example, we used the domain vorlon.local but you can use any domain you like.\nIn the VPCs to associate with the hosted zone section, in the Region field, select the region in which you created your VPC earlier, and in the VPC ID field, select your VPC ID from the list. \nThen, click on the Create hosted zone button below to create the hosted zone. \nIn the pane that represents your newly created hosted zone, in the Records section, click on the Create record button. \nIn the Create record pane, in the Record name field, enter the name that you want to use for your local RADIUS server host, in the Record type field, select the A – Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources option, and in the Value field, enter the IP address of your deployed local RADIUS server container that you noted down in the previous task. \nIn this example, we used the radius record name to create a radius.vorlon.local record but you can use any record name you like.\nNote: If you didn’t note down the IP address earlier, open a new browser tab and check the address by going to \nThen, click on the Create records button below. \nResult: You can configure your NAS devices in the VPC to access the local RADIUS server using its FQDN (in our example, radius.vorlon.local) in the VPC instead of its IP address (in our example, 10.1.136.187). You also need to configure the resolver in the NAS device to use one of the AWS DNS servers listed in the NS record, in the Value field.\nIf you need to restart the container and the IP address of the local RADIUS server changes, change the IP address in the record that you created for your hosted zone."

You will need it later. \nCreate a directory/IdP in SOTI ONE\nIn this section, you will create a directory in SOTI ONE for SAML integration with an identity provider (IdP).\nIn another tab of your browser, log in to your SOTI ONE tenant by accessing the following URL: https://your_tenant.identity.soti.net/, substituting your_tenant with your SOTI ONE tenant name. \nFrom now on, we will call this tab the SOTI tab.\nIn your SOTI ONE dashboard, click on the ≡ icon in the top-left corner, and then select the Directories/IdP option from the menu. \nIn the Directories pane, click on the NEW DIRECTORY button and select the IdP Connection option. \nIn the CREATE CONNECTION window, click on the SAML Based IdP option. \nIn the CONFIGURE IDP window: \nIn the Name field, enter the name for this directory. \nIn this example, we used the name Portnox Conditional Access, but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Domain section, click on the Select From Existing field and select your company domain. \nNote: All users with email addresses in this domain will be logged in using Zero Trust Network Access and will be managed using the identity provider’s directory, not the primary SOTI ONE user directory. We recommend to have at least one administrative service user account with a different domain to be able to log in to SOTI ONE in case of problems with the configuration.\nIn the User Attributes section, enter the name of the attributes as configured in your identity provider. \nThese attributes will be used by SOTI ONE to create user accounts on the basis of the attributes/claims sent by your configured identity provider. Every identity provider has different default values. For example, in Entra ID, the default claims for a new SAML application are http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress, http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname, http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname, and http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groups, but in Google Workspace, the only default value is NameID and you need to create custom attributes for a new SAML app.\nClick on the Downloads button and select the Identity Metadata option. \nYou will need this metadata file later to copy the configuration values to the Portnox tab.\nExport metadata from the Portnox tab and upload it in the SOTI tab\nIn this section, you will export the metadata from Portnox Cloud into a file and import that file with SOTI ONE.\nIn the Portnox tab, in the SAML metadata section, click on the Download metadata XML file link to download the XML file and save it to your local drive. \nIn the SOTI tab, click on the Import button in the IdP Metadata File section, and then upload the XML file downloaded from Portnox Cloud. \nCopy the configuration values from the metadata file to the Portnox tab\nIn this section, you will copy the configuration values stored in the downloaded metadata file and paste them in the relevant fields in Portnox Cloud.\nOpen the SOTI ONE metadata file downloaded earlier (SOTIIdentityMetadata.xml) in a browser. \nFor example, in Windows, simply double click on the downloaded file.\nIn the metadata content, find the <md:EntityDescriptor> element and its entityID attribute, and then copy its value (without the quotes) using your operating system’s copy shortcut. \nIn the Portnox tab, in the Resource properties section, click on the empty field under the Entity ID / Service Provider Entity URL heading and paste the copied value. \nIn the metadata content, find the <md:AssertionConsumerService> element with the Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST\" attribute. Copy the value of its Location attribute (without the quotes). \nIn the Portnox tab, in the Resource properties section, click on the empty field under the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL / Reply URL heading and paste the copied value. \nFinalize the configuration\nIn this section, you will finalize the configuration in Portnox Cloud and SOTI ONE.\nFinalize the configuration in the Portnox tab. \nOptional: Click on the Next button, and in the Policy enforcement section, in the Device risk assessment section, change the setting to Override with custom policy and then select a risk assessment policy if you want to assess risk with this application using a custom risk assessment policy, and in the Access control section, change the setting to Override with custom policy and then select an access control policy if you want to control access to this application using a custom access control policy. \nScroll all the way down to the end of the page, and then click on the Add resource button. \nFinalize the configuration in the SOTI tab. \nClick on the Create button to create the directory in SOTI. \nIn your SOTI ONE dashboard, click on the ≡ icon in the top-left corner, and then select the Users option from the menu. \nIn the Directory selector, select the directory/IdP that you created earlier in SOTI ONE. \nIn the top-right corner, click on the NEW USER GROUP button. \nIn the ADD IDP USER GROUP window, click on the + icon, enter the group NAME, optionally activate the IDENTITY ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATOR switch (if applicable), and click on the ADD button. \nNote: If you use the user.groups claim in Entra ID, in the NAME field, enter the group’s Object ID, not the human-readable Entra ID Name.\nNote: All users from your selected domain who are assigned to this group in your identity provider will be authorized to use SOTI ONE.

For example, you can use native SSH connection using PuTTY software on Windows and the local key downloaded while creating the virtual machine.\nIn your SSH window, type the following commands: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install syslog-ng to install syslog-ng software. \nThen, type the following command: sudo nano /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf to edit syslog-ng configuration. \nFollow the steps described in the Datadog documentation for syslog-ng to add the following configuration sections to the syslog-ng.conf file but modify them as follows: \nAdd a new source definition to obtain logs from the network via port 514. \nsource s_network { tcp(ip(0.0.0.0) port(514)); };\nThis source represents the logs incoming from Portnox Cloud.\nDo not add the s_files source as described in Datadog documentation, because it is not needed if the logs are collected from an external source (Portnox Cloud). \nIn the destination section, add a pointer to the certificate authority file. \ndestination d_datadog { http( url(\"https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu/api/v2/logs?ddsource=<SOURCE>&ddtags=<TAG_1:VALUE_1,TAG_2:VALUE_2>\") method(\"POST\") ca-file(\"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\") headers(\"Content-Type: application/json\", \"Accept: application/json\", \"DD-API-KEY: DATADOG_API_KEY\") body(\"<${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST:--} ${PROGRAM:--} ${PID:--} ${MSGID:--} ${SDATA:--} $MSG\\n\") ); };\nNote: You don’t have to add the ca-file line unless you encounter certificate-related errors when trying to connect to the Datadog HTTPS intake. You may need to modify the path to the file, if your operating system CA file is in a different location. \nInstead of the ca-file line, you can add peer-verify(no), but this is recommended only for lab purposes, because it turns off the verification of the remote peer certificate and makes man-in-the-middle attacks possible.\nIn the log path section, instead of the configuration proposed by Datadog, add the following log path definition: \nlog { source(s_network); destination(d_datadog); };\nThis means that the only logs sent to Datadog will be logs from Portnox Cloud, not the local virtual machine logs.\nSave your configuration to the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file. \nFor example, if using the nano editor, press CTRL+O to write the file and then CRTL+X to exit.\nIn your SSH window, type the following command: sudo systemctl restart syslog-ng to restart syslog-ng after configuration changes. \nResult: The syslog-ng software is configured, running, and waiting for events from Portnox Cloud."

  "text": "Quick start steps with Zero Trust Network Access\nIn this topic, you will learn the steps you need to take to configure the Portnox™ Zero Trust Network Access service.\nIf you already completed some of the steps, proceed to the next steps.\nNote: Portnox Cloud has functions to control network access, not just access to resources such as applications and services. If you only use Portnox Cloud for Zero Trust Network Access, in any of the configuration steps, you can skip the steps relating to network access and do only the steps related to resource access.\nCreate a Portnox Cloud tenant to access the service. \nIn this step, you create an account with Portnox Cloud and your own tenant. You only need to do this once.\nLog in to Portnox Cloud to start working with the service. \nIn this step, you access the tenant that you created earlier. You must complete this step every time you want to work with Portnox Cloud.\nConfigure your cloud-based authentication repository in Portnox Cloud. \nFor example:\nConfigure Microsoft Entra ID as your authentication repository.\nConfigure Google Workspace as your authentication repository.\nConfigure Okta Workforce Identity as your authentication repository.\nConfigure local Active Directory as your authentication repository.\nConfigure OpenLDAP as your authentication repository.\nAlternatively, manage your accounts internally within Portnox Cloud with Portnox accounts.\nConfigure access to SSO web applications: \nNote: You need to complete these steps only if you will be using Zero Trust Network Access to secure access to SSO web applications. If you will be using Zero Trust Network Access to secure access only to hosted resources, skip this step.\nConfigure an identity provider. \nThe identity provider is a web app, often configured in your authentication repository, that checks the identity of users of web applications. You should set up an identity provider that can work with the authentication repository you set up earlier in this process.\nConfigure applications to use ZTNA. \nFor each web application, the setup steps are different. We have a collection of guides for well-known web applications. However, if your application is not on the list, look at your application’s administrative guide. Search for topics like SAML integration.\nConfigure access to hosted resources: \nNote: You need to complete these steps only if you will be using Zero Trust Network Access to secure access to hosted resources. If you will be using Zero Trust Network Access to secure access only to SSO web applications, skip this step.\nCreate the Zero Trust Network Access gateway, run the Zero Trust Network Access Docker container, and add resources.\nIf you host your private resources on-premises and want to use a Linux machine as a gateway, configure a Linux-based Docker container.\nIf you host your private resources on-premises and want to use a Windows machine as a gateway, configure a Windows-based Docker container.\nOptional: Install AgentP on user devices or ask users to install AgentP on their devices. \nNote: Zero Trust Network Access needs a user certificate on the device to be able to authenticate with the resource. You can either get such a certificate by installing AgentP on the device, or by using an Intune/Jamf agent already on the device and configuring Intune/Jamf to work with the Portnox SCEP server.\nIf you want users to install AgentP, send them the following link: https://docs.portnox.com/byod/. These are end-user instructions for all popular desktop/mobile operating systems: Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. They teach the users how to install AgentP.\nIf you want to automatically distribute AgentP to user devices, here are some guides for popular endpoint management systems:\nMicrosoft Windows Group Policy\nMicrosoft Intune\nJamf\nKandji\nNote: If you choose this option, skip the next step.\nOptional: If you use Microsoft Intune or Jamf in your organization and you don’t want to use AgentP: \nIntegrate Portnox Cloud with Intune or Jamf. \nConfigure Intune or Jamf so that the devices request SCEP certificates from Portnox Cloud. \nNote: If you choose this option, skip the previous step.\nConfigure groups, policies, and more. \nOnce you have Zero Trust Network Access working, you can now adjust it specifically to your needs.\nManage groups of application users. \nGroups allow you to set different access policies for different users. For example, you can allow only your developers to access your development applications, and only your finance department to access your finance applications. If you choose to control this access at the application-level, you can create one group for all users.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one group called Default, which contains all your users that are not specifically assigned to any other groups.\nConfigure risk assessment policies and assign them to groups. \nRisk assessment policies help you check if a user’s device is secure enough to access applications. You can give different importance to various conditions, like not having antivirus software or using an old version of the operating system. If the total score exceeds a certain limit, you can consider the device as unsafe.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one risk assessment policy called System Default Policy, which is set up with recommended security measures for all operating systems, and which is assigned to the Default group.\nConfigure access control policies for applications and assign them to groups. \nAn access control policy for an application decides what to do if the risk assessment policy labels the device as unsafe. You can choose to let unsafe devices use your applications, or you can tell the user what they should do to make their device safe.\nNote: By default, your Portnox Cloud portal has one access control policy called System Default Policy, which is set up to deny access to unsafe devices, and which is assigned to the Default group."

  "text": "Integrate with Datadog using a syslog forwarder and TLS\nIn this topic, you will learn how to send Portnox™ Cloud alerts to the Datadog SIEM solution using a syslog forwarder with TLS for increased security.\nNote: Portnox Cloud now has a direct Datadog integration, so this method is no longer recommended. However, we are keeping this documentation for reference purposes.\nTo integrate with Datadog using a syslog forwarder and TLS:\nDeploy a machine or a virtual machine as a syslog message collector.\nInstall syslog-ng (or similar software) on this machine and accept syslog events via TLS from Portnox Cloud.\nSend the syslog events to the Datadog HTTPS intake API via HTTPS.\nIn this example configuration, we are using a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure with syslog-ng and a TLS connection. Using this configuration, the entire communications is encrypted using TLS (Portnox Cloud to syslog collector) and HTTPS (syslog collector to Datadog).\nCreate a Linux virtual machine\nTo integrate with Datadog, you need to run syslog software on a physical or virtual machine, so that it can collect alert data from Portnox™ Cloud and send that data to Datadog. In this section, you will learn how to create and configure such a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure based on the Linux Ubuntu operating system.\nOpen the Azure Portal dashboard in your browser. \nIn the Azure services menu on your dashboard, click on the Create a Resource option. \nIn the Marketplace pane, in the Search the Marketplace field, type virtual machine and press the ↩ key. In the Virtual machine tile below, click on the Create button and select the Virtual machine option from the context menu. \nIn the Create a virtual machine pane, enter the details for your virtual machine and then click on the Create button to create it. \nNote: Select one of the available Linux images, for example, Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 and its parameters according to your business, access, and security needs. Since the parameters of the virtual machine greatly depend on your specific environment and needs, the guidance on these parameters is beyond the scope of this guide and you should treat the example below as a lab environment only.\nIn the virtual machine pane, click on the public IP assigned to this machine to open the Configuration pane for the IP address associated with the machine. \nIn the Configuration pane for the IP address of the virtual machine, in the DNS name label (optional) field, enter a unique name that will form part of the FQDN for your virtual machine, and then click on the Save button. \nIn this example, we used the name datadog but you can use any name you like.\nThe FQDN of your virtual machine is the label that you enter followed by the domain name shown under the DNS name label field. You can also see it on the Overview pane as DNS name.\nCreate a port rule to open port 6514. \nThis is the standard port used by syslog software to collect alerts from external sources such as Portnox Cloud using TLS. The virtual machine must be able to accept information from Portnox Cloud on this port. You can use a different port number than 6514, if needed, but then you have to modify the configuration of syslog-ng and Portnox Cloud.\nIn the virtual machine pane, in the left-hand side menu, click on the Network settings option. \nOn the right-hand side, click on the Create port rule button, and then select the Inbound port rule option from the context menu. \nIn the Add inbound security rule pane, fill in the following fields and then click on the Add button: \nIn the Source field, select IP Addresses\nIn the Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges, type 23.97.155.157, 52.168.164.222, 20.72.156.11, and 51.124.144.69 (these are the Portnox Cloud IP addresses from which information is sent to SIEM software)\nIn the Destination field, select Any\nIn the Destination port ranges field, type 6514\nIn the Protocol field, select TCP\nIn the Action field, select Allow\nGenerate a certificate for your syslog collector\nIn this section, you will use OpenSSL software on the virtual machine to generate a self-signed certificate, which Portnox Cloud will use to connect to the collector via TLS.\nIn the virtual machine pane, in the left-hand side menu, click on the Connect option. \nIn the Connect pane, select the preferred SSH connection method to connect to the virtual machine. \nNote: Since the connection method depends on your specific environment, needs, and software, the guidance on the specific method is beyond the scope of this guide. For example, you can use native SSH connection using PuTTY software on Windows and the local key downloaded while creating the virtual machine.\nOptional: If OpenSSL is not installed by default, in your SSH window, type the following commands: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install openssl to install OpenSSL. \nGenerate the certificate using OpenSSL by typing the following commands in your SSH window: \nNote: In this example, we use the /etc/ssl/ directory but you can use another directory if you like. However, you will need to adjust further configuration steps.\nType: cd /etc/ssl/ to change to the destination directory. \nType: sudo openssl genrsa -out mykey.key 2048 to generate a private key for your certificate. \nType: sudo openssl req -new -key mykey.key -out mycsr.csr to create a certificate request that uses the key that you just created. \nNote: You will be asked for details such as the country, city, and other information for the certificate. Enter information that is relevant to your business. When asked for the Common Name, enter the FQDN of your virtual machine, in this example: datadog.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com.\nType: sudo openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in mycsr.csr -signkey mykey.key -out mycert.crt to generate a certificate on the basis of the request that you just created. \nNote: This example certificate is valid for 1 year only. Adjust the parameters as needed.\nType: cat /etc/ssl/mycert.crt to print the certificate to the SSH console. Copy the entire text from the SSH console, paste it into a local text file, and save that file locally. \nYou will need this file to configure Portnox Cloud to communicate with the collector using TLS.\nIn this example, we saved the certificate as datadog-vm.crt.\nInstall and configure syslog-ng\nIn this section, you will install syslog-ng on the virtual machine, and configure it to accept events from the network via TLS and send them to Datadog via HTTPS.\nIn your SSH window, type the following commands: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install syslog-ng to install syslog-ng software. \nThen, type the following command: sudo nano /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf to edit syslog-ng configuration. \nFollow the steps described in the Datadog documentation for syslog-ng to add the following configuration sections to the syslog-ng.conf file but modify them as follows: \nAdd a new source definition to obtain logs from the network via port 6514 and TLS. \nsource s_tls { network( ip(0.0.0.0) port(6514) transport(\"tls\") tls( key-file(\"/etc/ssl/mykey.key\") cert-file(\"/etc/ssl/mycert.crt\") peer-verify(optional-untrusted) ) ); };\nThis source represents the logs incoming from Portnox Cloud through a TLS connection.\nNote: If you used different directory or file names when creating the private key and the certificate, adjust the paths in the configuration.\nDo not add the s_files source as described in Datadog documentation, because it is not needed if the logs are collected from an external source (Portnox Cloud). \nIn the destination section, add a pointer to the certificate authority file. \ndestination d_datadog { http( url(\"https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu/api/v2/logs?ddsource=<SOURCE>&ddtags=<TAG_1:VALUE_1,TAG_2:VALUE_2>\") method(\"POST\") ca-file(\"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\") headers(\"Content-Type: application/json\", \"Accept: application/json\", \"DD-API-KEY: DATADOG_API_KEY\") body(\"<${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST:--} ${PROGRAM:--} ${PID:--} ${MSGID:--} ${SDATA:--} $MSG\\n\") ); };\nNote: You don’t have to add the ca-file line unless you encounter certificate-related errors when trying to connect to the Datadog HTTPS intake. You may need to modify the path to the file, if your operating system CA file is in a different location. \nInstead of the ca-file line, you can add peer-verify(no), but this is recommended only for lab purposes, because it turns off the verification of the remote peer certificate and makes man-in-the-middle attacks possible.\nIn the log path section, instead of the configuration proposed by Datadog, add the following log path definition: \nlog { source(s_tls); destination(d_datadog); };\nThis means that the only logs sent to Datadog will be logs received through TLS from Portnox Cloud, not the local virtual machine logs.\nSave your configuration to the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file. \nFor example, if using the nano editor, press CTRL+O to write the file and then CRTL+X to exit.\nIn your SSH window, type the following command: sudo systemctl restart syslog-ng to restart syslog-ng after configuration changes. \nResult: The syslog-ng software is configured, running, and waiting for events coming through TLS from Portnox Cloud.\nConfigure Portnox Cloud\nIn this section, you will learn how to configure Portnox™ Cloud to send alert data using TLS to the virtual machine with syslog-ng so that it forwards the data to the Datadog intake.\nIn the Cloud portal top menu, click on the Settings option. \nIn the Cloud portal left-hand menu, click on the option. \nCreate a new SIEM integration with Datadog via the collector virtual machine. \nIn the SIEM integration service section, click on the Add new SIEM link. \nThe NEW SIEM INTEGRATION section opens.\nIn the Type field, select the Custom option. \nIn the Name field, enter the name for the new integration. \nIn this example, we used the name Datadog but you can use any name you like.\nIn the Status field, select the Enabled option. \nIn the Protocol type field, select the Syslog over TLS option. \nIn the Server certificate trust field, select the Server certificate option. \nClick on the Browse button under the Upload server certificate heading, and upload the certificate file that you saved earlier. \nIn this example, we saved the file locally earlier as datadog-vm.crt.\nIn the Authentication field, select the None option. \nNote: You can also set up authentication using a certificate, but you will need to upload your certificate to the collector virtual machine and configure syslog-ng to verify this certificate.\nIn the Host name field, enter the FQDN of your virtual machine that you created earlier in Azure. \nIn this example, the FQDN is datadog.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com.\nIn the Port field, type 6514. \nThis is the port number that you opened on the virtual machine, which is the standard port number for syslog-ng external log collection through TLS.\nIn the Communication method field, select the Direct option. \nIn the Data format field, select the CEF option. \nClick on the Save button to add the integration. \nOptional: Test the configuration by clicking on the Test button. \nOptional: To configure the types of alerts sent to your SIEM solution, see the following topic: Portnox Cloud alerts. \nYou can also send all of the Portnox Cloud activity log (activities performed by administrators in Portnox Cloud) to your SIEM solution. To do this, go to , activate the Activity log switch, and click on the Save button.\nResult: Datadog is receiving alerts from Portnox Cloud through a secure connection.\nYou can confirm that, for example, by accessing the Log Explorer."
